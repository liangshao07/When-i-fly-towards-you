00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,080
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,360
<i>A Fluttering Feeling I Can't Ignore.</i>

6
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
GRADE 10, CLASS 1

7
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,240
That's all for this class.

8
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,200
I would like to make an announcement.

9
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,560
During today's last two classes,

10
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,880
we've invited a psychology lecturer
from Jiangyi University

11
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,560
to give a psychology seminar

12
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
at our school.

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,160
Students who feel like they need it

14
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,160
may attend.

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,120
It's not compulsory.

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,560
Students who aren't attending

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,080
will self-study in the classroom.

18
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,840
Keep quiet. Understand?

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
-Yes!
-Yes!

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,480
Class is dismissed.

21
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,960
Will you two
attend the psychology seminar?

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,880
No.

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,600
It sounds like a dry lecture

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
with a bunch of unintelligible theories.

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
How boring.

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,080
Jiang Jia said she saved us seats.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,440
-I'll tell her to save two only.
-Hold on!

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,640
Jiang Jia?

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,320
Are they going too?

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,360
They're already there.

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,960
I think

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,600
life has been pretty stressful lately.

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,919
There's no harm in attending it, right?

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,520
Let's go.

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,760
That is why communication is so important.

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,320
Good and effective communication

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,440
is often the key to solving problems.

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,280
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL
SPECIAL SEMINAR ON PSYCHOLOGY

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,840
I noticed

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,400
that some students were nodding off.

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,680
Why?

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,280
Did you think what I said earlier

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,720
was boring?

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,960
Then let's talk

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,680
about something more interesting.

46
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,600
What is considered interesting?

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,840
You usually listen to music, right?

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,600
Who do you like listening to?

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,240
-Of course.
-Jay Chou!

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
You have a pretty good taste.

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,080
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL
SPECIAL SEMINAR ON PSYCHOLOGY

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,000
I remember Jay Chou had a song

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,040
called "Her Eyelashes."

54
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,840
When I was in high school,

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,040
the song was often played
during the lunch break.

56
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,040
I liked memorizing vocabulary
at lunchtime,

57
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,120
while my deskmate

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,880
liked napping on the table.

59
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,680
Whenever I closed my textbook
to memorize the words,

60
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,280
I always saw her long eyelashes
in the corner of my eye.

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,480
But later on, I gave up
memorizing vocabulary at lunchtime

62
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,920
because it was so ineffective.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,720
I wasn't sure if it was that song

64
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,960
that affected me

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,880
or something else.

66
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,360
That was until I learned a certain word.

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,640
"Fluttering."

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,920
I wonder if you have ever felt this way.

69
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,120
When someone becomes special to you,

70
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
you just can't seem
to keep your eyes off them.

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,320
That's so accurate.

72
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,720
Even a simple smile

73
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,160
or sudden eye contact

74
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,400
will be caught by someone who cares.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
They will remain excited for a long time.

76
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,800
Some of you here

77
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,400
must've had similar experiences.

78
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,280
The feeling is both confusing

79
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
and novel.

80
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,079
In fact,

81
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,440
these are all normal parts of adolescence.

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,120
I don't think he was right at all.

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,320
"We become sneaky

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,960
when we like someone"?

85
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,800
I don't think so.

86
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,040
He said "careful," not "sneaky."

87
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
That's more or less the same.

88
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,760
Anyway, if I like someone,

89
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,880
I would show it openly

90
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,200
and let everyone know about it.

91
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,040
How about you, Lurang?

92
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,120
I think you would be the sneaky type.

93
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,160
Figure yourself out first.

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,040
How rare!

95
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,520
You're not buying snacks.

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,000
Jiangjiang spent a fortune yesterday

97
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,400
on a beautiful glass jar,

98
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,800
so she has used up all her money.

99
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
It's all right.

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,080
You can eat mine.

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,360
Why did you buy a glass jar?

102
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,120
It's a secret.

103
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,120
That's right.

104
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,160
I just got my contest prize money.

105
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,640
Take your pick. It's on me.

106
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,440
Thank you.

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,560
Don't grab too much.

108
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,760
You're a hearty eater.

109
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,160
Gu Ran, you're awesome.

110
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,840
I'll help myself then.

111
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,080
Rangrang, these are delicious. Take them.

112
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,080
Do you know what will appear on your face

113
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,440
after eating too much junk food?

114
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
A smile?

115
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,440
You're exceptionally handsome today.

116
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,280
You're handsome.

117
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,560
Shall we?

118
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,840
Let's go.

119
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,400
Doesn't he seem a bit too happy today?

120
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,440
Look at that girl.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,240
She's quite pretty.

122
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,040
I also think her hair clip is pretty.

123
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,600
Jiang Jia has an identical one.

124
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,840
It's pink.

125
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,960
I think it looks cuter
on Jiang Jia though.

126
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,400
I mean,

127
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Jiang Jia has a bigger face,

128
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,920
so it suits her better.

129
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,560
That's all.

130
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,560
Let's go.

131
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
It's a beautiful sunny day.

132
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,360
Do you know?

133
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,200
He had just bit it
and the teacher called him.

134
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,800
So he spat it all out into his hands.

135
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
Su Zaizai.

136
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,360
Where's Jiang Jia?

137
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,000
She went to see Qianyu.

138
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,920
She has something important to do.

139
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,400
I just remembered that
I forgot my homework. I'll go get it.

140
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,240
You guys go ahead. Don't wait for me.

141
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,080
{\an8}There should be no one around
at this hour, right?

142
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,400
Which one

143
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,120
is Qianyu's seat?

144
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
"Li Cheng."

145
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,240
"Huang Ming."

146
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,440
"Wang Zhi."

147
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,440
Found it.

148
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,000
What are you doing in our classroom?

149
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,840
I...

150
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,440
Sorry, I just came to drop something off.

151
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,160
Gu Ran,

152
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,320
how could you scare people
at night like that?

153
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,480
I was about to say that to you.

154
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,840
How could you secretly sneak

155
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,440
into another class

156
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,920
at night like that?

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
I didn't.

158
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,680
Jiang Jia, are you dumb?

159
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,640
If you don't leave your name on the gift,

160
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
how will the receiver know who sent it?

161
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,840
That doesn't matter to me

162
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,080
as long as they receive the gift.

163
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
You're such a coward at times.

164
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,600
You don't have a crush.

165
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,800
You wouldn't understand.

166
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,240
Whatever.

167
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,440
Why wouldn't I understand?

168
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,200
Whatever.

169
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,120
Are you sure
your keys are in the classroom?

170
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,240
-Someone is coming.
-I'm sure.

171
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I found them.

172
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
Luckily, you didn't lose them outside.
Let's go.

173
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's go.

174
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,920
Thank goodness. We weren't seen.

175
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,400
What are you staring at?

176
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,720
Are you stunned?

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,840
Nonsense.

178
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,400
I didn't even want to hide.

179
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,960
We weren't doing anything bad.

180
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,960
Then why are you blushing?

181
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm not.

182
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
It got scratched.

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
It was all your fault.

184
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,560
You just had to hide.

185
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,040
Have you forgotten about the time

186
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,560
Zaizai was accused of stealing money?

187
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,560
I don't want to cause misunderstandings.

188
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,280
Still,

189
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,320
wouldn't the consequences be worse

190
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,680
if we both got caught hiding?

191
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,640
Why?

192
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,160
The school has been
cracking down on puppy love.

193
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,960
Who would be so unkind to themselves
as to be involved with you?

194
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680
You're so clumsy.

195
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,000
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL
ACADEMIC TRANSCRIPT REQUEST FORM

196
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,920
"Needed for going abroad."

197
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,760
Is Qianyu

198
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,040
going abroad?

199
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,920
That's all for today's class.

200
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,440
A round of applause, please.

201
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,480
All right. Thank you for the support!

202
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you

203
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,280
for giving me your attention.

204
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,680
This session

205
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,360
was mainly about the eyes.

206
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,280
It's not something you can learn

207
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,680
in a day or two.

208
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,880
So make sure

209
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,800
to practice it more at home.

210
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,760
One day, your eyes will be like mine,

211
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,360
bright

212
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,560
and piercing.

213
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,280
By the way,

214
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,880
your senior schoolmate, Shen Qianyu,

215
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,280
will be leaving the country soon.

216
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,400
He has about a week left.

217
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,120
You all should cherish your time with him.

218
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,560
So then...

219
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,160
Is Qianyu going abroad?

220
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,120
That's right.

221
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,960
-He...
-It's because of my parents' job transfer.

222
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,480
I had no choice.

223
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,440
Yes, I think...

224
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,800
Does the countdown start today?

225
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,600
Hold on. You guys keep interrupting me.

226
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,040
I seem to be the extra in this class.

227
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,400
You guys have a chat and catch up.

228
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,880
Though I haven't known you for very long,

229
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm still grateful to all of you

230
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
for joining the Drama Club.

231
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,320
I hope I'll have the chance to see you

232
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,800
on a bigger stage in the future.

233
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,760
Keep it up.

234
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,040
Did you find out about it yesterday?

235
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes.

236
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,480
When I went to drop off the stars,

237
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,400
I accidentally saw the documents
he had prepared for his departure.

238
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,960
Why is it so sudden?

239
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,840
Zaizai, I've made up my mind.

240
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
About what?

241
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,960
I didn't give him the stars in person

242
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,720
because I thought
we had a lot of time left

243
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,120
and could slowly get to know each other.

244
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,480
But there is no time now.

245
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,920
I don't want to have any regrets.

246
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,160
So what do you plan to do?

247
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,000
<i>Did you know</i>

248
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,120
<i>that we will meet 29,2 million people</i>

249
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,440
<i>in our lifetime?</i>

250
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,720
<i>When I think about it,</i>

251
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,760
<i>meeting you at the age of 16</i>

252
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,880
<i>should be one
of my life's few lucky moments.</i>

253
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,120
<i>The first time I saw you,</i>

254
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,480
<i>you were sitting on the grass
and playing the guitar.</i>

255
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,200
<i>There were so many people around,</i>

256
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,960
<i>but I saw you right away.</i>

257
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,520
"I couldn't help

258
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,680
but start to get close to you.

259
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,280
I asked around for your grade and class

260
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,800
and learned about your preferences.

261
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,240
I admit that I'm not a persistent person.

262
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,480
But after meeting you,

263
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,920
I've found a new meaning to persistence."

264
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,160
What do you think?

265
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,480
I'm not done writing it yet.

266
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,680
I think it's pretty good.

267
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,720
I've never written a love letter though.

268
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,520
I'm not sure if this is how it is written.

269
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,040
You're so good at writing essays,

270
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,480
so you should be fine.

271
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,480
Really?

272
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,800
Yes. Also, look.

273
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,120
Over here.

274
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,040
Su Zaizai,

275
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,080
Jiang Jia,

276
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,840
have you turned in your math homework yet?

277
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,040
Are you guys

278
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,680
copying homework?

279
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,240
You're right!

280
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,960
We just have one question left.

281
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,960
{\an8}We're done. Here you go.

282
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,000
Wang Nan's footsteps don't make a sound.

283
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,560
Luckily, he didn't see it.

284
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,560
It's okay. You didn't write your name.

285
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,000
That's true.

286
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,360
Zaizai, is the letter with you?

287
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,880
I think I stuck it in my homework.

288
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,440
Where is my homework?

289
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,120
I just turned it in.

290
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,360
There are so many people.

291
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,120
We're done for.

292
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,080
It's okay.

293
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,720
Mr. Lin is a serious procrastinator.

294
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,520
He probably won't
grade our homework so soon.

295
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,120
Let's come back at lunch break.

296
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
All right.

297
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,000
Zhang Lurang,

298
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,640
I heard that Class 9's math papers
were mixed up with ours.

299
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,200
Ms. Zhang sent me to help you sort them.

300
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,520
It's fine. I'm almost done.

301
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,240
It's okay. Let me help you.

302
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Su Zaizai got so many questions wrong.

303
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,560
She got almost all the main questions
at the back wrong.

304
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,680
If it were you,

305
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,520
I don't think you would want random people
looking through your papers.

306
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,319
I was just stating facts.

307
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,839
She was never good at math.

308
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,440
She wasn't even in our grade's top 100

309
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,760
in the last midterm exam.

310
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,960
Excluding science scores,

311
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,000
she would be in our school's top 20.

312
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,640
Even including those scores,

313
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,760
I can be in the top 20.

314
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,800
Why can't I talk about her bad results?

315
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,800
MATH BOOK, SU ZAIZAI

316
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,480
She makes so many mistakes
even in her regular homework.

317
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,280
What is this?

318
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,120
"The first time I saw you,

319
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,120
you were sitting on the grass
and playing the guitar.

320
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,960
There were so many people around,

321
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,920
but I saw you right away."

322
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,080
Su Zaizai is writing a love letter
to someone.

323
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,880
Do you know this guitar player?

324
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,880
This is her privacy.

325
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,760
You only said that

326
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,120
because it belongs to Su Zaizai.

327
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,000
You can leave if you don't want to help.

328
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,720
MATH BOOK, SU ZAIZAI

329

MATH BOOK, SU ZAIZAI

331
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,560
You're here as well.

332
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,680
The first one over here.

333
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,760
Rangrang,

334
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,960
did you see something?

335
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,640
No.

336
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,800
Your name is written so big

337
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,840
that it's unforgettable.

338
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,360
They're planning

339
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,960
to switch to a new student club

340
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,240
even before Qianyu leaves.

341
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,160
What do you mean?

342
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,640
Isn't that guy from the Guitar Club?

343
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,800
Is that so?

344
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,440
Su Zaizai is writing a love letter
to someone.

345
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,200
Do you know this guitar player?

346
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,720
Thank you.

347
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
You're welcome.

348
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,440
You can ask me directly
if you have questions about guitars.

349
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,560
{\an8}It's a good thing we asked him.

350
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,400
Otherwise, it would be so embarrassing

351
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,080
if Qianyu saw the absurd music theories

352
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,080
that I wrote in the letter.

353
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,040
Zhang Lurang!

354
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Are Guan Fang and I invisible?

355
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,640
You've gained some self-awareness.

356
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,360
What were you two talking about over here?

357
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,800
You looked so excited.

358
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,240
It's a secret.

359
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
By the way,
we'll have a fitness test in this class.

360
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,200
The boys will be doing pull-ups.

361
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,000
How many can you do, Rangrang?

362
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,960
It's a secret.

363
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,760
Are you two the only ones left?

364
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,840
It's your turn. I'll hold your ankles.

365
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,800
Get ready.

366
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,360
Sir,

367
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
Mr. Xu sent me to ask you for the key

368
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,760
to the basketball equipment room.

369
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,240
Has Class 1 finished the fitness test?

370
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
The key.

371
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,920
I think I left it in the office.

372
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,600
I'll go and get it.

373
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,560
Sure.

374
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,760
You can record your own scores.

375
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,680
Okay.

376
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,960
I think you're more reliable.

377
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,560
You don't seem likely to cheat.

378
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,880
Record their scores for me.

379
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,040
Okay.

380
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,600
Ready.

381
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,640
Start.

382
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,440
Thirty seconds left.

383
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,440
Twenty-two.

384
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,960
Twenty-one.

385
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,120
It's 22.

386
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,880
Non-standard sit-ups don't count.

387
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,680
Time is up.

388
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,880
You guys did 36, right?

389
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,840
Thirty.

390
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,080
You did 26.

391
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,000
You just passed the test.

392
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,800
Rangrang,

393
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,440
you're truly stern and impartial.

394
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,520
Rangrang, are you having a bad day?

395
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,520
No.

396
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,960
Are you still denying it?

397
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,360
You touched your neck.

398
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,560
Rangrang,

399
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,760
did you see something?

400
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,360
No.

401
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,440
Your name is written so big

402
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
that it's unforgettable.

403
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,960
You didn't see

404
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,160
what I put

405
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,440
in my homework, did you?

406
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,400
Could it be that you thought

407
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,680
I wrote that for someone else

408
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,120
and got jealous?

409
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,120
No.

410
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,000
I have to lecture you about this.

411
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,760
You couldn't even recognize my handwriting

412
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,960
after all the tutoring classes we've had.

413
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,560
This is so heartbreaking.

414
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,680
As a punishment,

415
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,200
you should read my notes carefully again.

416
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,760
You'll have to remember it this time.

417
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,360
As for making me suffer in PE class,

418
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,560
I'll forgive you.

419
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,040
Lurang,

420
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,520
I warmed up some milk
and made some for you too.

421
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,080
Thank you, Uncle.

422
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,800
What happened to make you so happy?

423
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,840
I...

424
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,680
SU ZAIZAI'S EXCLUSIVE SECRET

425
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,280
All right. Go to bed early.

426
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,840
Remember to drink the milk.

427
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,800
Okay.

428
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,640
Qianyu?

429
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,920
What brings you to the Grade 10 area?

430
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,120
I need to go
to the Office of Academic Affairs.

431
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,960
Are you leaving very soon?

432
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,600
I'm leaving in about two weeks.

433
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,760
Two weeks. That's so soon.

434
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,800
I have one more recital
before I go abroad.

435
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,120
If you have time,

436
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,280
you can come and watch it.

437
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,800
Consider it a farewell.

438
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,560
ADMISSION TICKET

439
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,000
ADMISSION TICKET

440
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,960
Qianyu only gave me this ticket.

441
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,880
Does this mean

442
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,280
that I'm special?

443
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,040
ADMISSION TICKET

444
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,000
Two days ago, you were so upset

445
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,520
about Qianyu leaving the country.

446
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,400
Why are you in such a good mood today?

447
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,120
You're over the moon.

448
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,240
Did you win the lottery?

449
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,640
You can say that.

450
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,160
It's a good thing anyway.

451
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,840
Why do you all
have good things going on recently?

452
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,080
Lurang is also in a good mood today
for some reason.

453
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,600
So what's up? You haven't told us yet.

454
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,960
Don't envy me

455
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,240
after I tell you guys about it.

456
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,880
Qianyu invited me to his recital

457
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,400
next Friday night.

458
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,920
So?

459
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,320
So

460
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,360
I won't be joining you guys that day.

461
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,800
I'm letting you know in advance.

462
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,600
Why won't you be joining us?

463
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,960
We're going as well.

464
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,240
Qianyu was at the basketball court

465
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,240
during lunch.

466
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,480
He told us about it.

467
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,680
He even invited all of us.

468
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
So I wasn't the only one.

469
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,760
What's wrong with her now?

470
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,520
Her special prize became a pity award.

471
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,360
Why do you have tutoring

472
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,960
with Zhang Lurang on the weekend?

473
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,560
<i>The monthly exam is coming up.</i>

474
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,120
<i>You know how poorly I scored</i>

475
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,240
<i>on the last math exam.</i>

476
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,280
Who will go shoe shopping with me then?

477
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,040
He Yu and Fu Yao are both busy.

478
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,240
<i>Why don't you ask Guan Fang?</i>

479
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,680
<i>A guy might provide a different insight.</i>

480
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,200
You have a point.

481
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,120
Then I'll ask him.

482
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,800
Hello, Guan Fang? Are you free tomorrow?

483
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,520
Grocery shopping with your grandma?

484
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,640
Never mind then. Bye.

485
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,880
Who else can I ask?

486
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,800
Do you have any other plans?

487
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,000
You're all dressed up

488
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,760
as if you're meeting someone important.

489
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,880
What? That's nonsense!

490
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,360
Don't put it like that.

491
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,800
This is how I usually dress.

492
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,520
Don't flatter yourself.

493
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,760
I didn't say it was me.

494
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,120
Let's get going. It's getting late.

495
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,800
How could you not

496
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,200
show appreciation
for what you've been given?

497
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,520
I freed up my busy schedule

498
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,760
to go shopping with you,

499
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,200
but you don't have any gratitude.

500
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,600
But then again,

501
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,840
am I the only one here today?

502
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,480
Yes, it's just you.

503
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,600
You have a good taste

504
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
for choosing me.

505
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,480
This had nothing to do with my taste.

506
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,720
I asked everyone else.

507
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
You're the only one free.

508
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,720
-I...
-Wait, no.

509
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,360
My elderly neighbor was free as well,

510
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,600
but I was worried
his fashion sense would be outdated.

511
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,360
So on second thought, I went with you.

512
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,560
At least you're a boy.

513
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,520
Your tastes should differ
from that of a girl.

514
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,720
What did you mean by "at least"?

515
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,600
How pretty.

516
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,000
Try them on if you find them pretty.

517
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,000
Forget it.

518
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm not here to buy these today.

519
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,560
Excuse me. I would like to try these on.

520
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,680
That was close.

521
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,720
You've clearly never worn heels before.

522
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,920
Why did you still buy them?

523
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,880
I'm a size 37.

524
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,000
These are size 37 shoes.

525
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,320
They should fit me.

526
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,480
Besides,

527
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,680
I'm already walking

528
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,160
much more steadily, okay?

529
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,640
{\an8}But didn't you like
that pair of sneakers a lot?

530
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,840
We have to make choices

531
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,840
about a lot of things.

532
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,320
We can't have it all.

533
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Are you doing this for Qianyu's recital?

534
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,560
Why are you asking the obvious?

535
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,440
If you were Qianyu,

536
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,440
what would you think of me?

537
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,680
How would I know?

538
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,880
True.

539
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,080
You'll never be him.

540
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,720
Still, thank you

541
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,600
for shopping with me for so long today.

542
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,800
Nobody has been so patient
with me for a long time.

543
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm very happy.

544
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,480
Let me get that.

545
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,040
Thank you.

546
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,400
{\an8}<i>Traces of the youthful thoughts that year</i>

547
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,120
{\an8}<i>seemed to have been exposed</i>

548
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,520
{\an8}<i>along with the early summer.</i>

549
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,200
Sorry. Please excuse me.

550
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,440
<i>Then they put on a not-so-clever disguise.</i>

552
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,520
<i>but blamed the heat</i>

553
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,920
<i>for his sweaty palms.</i>

554
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,440
<i>And only one of the two parties knew</i>

555
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,960
<i>that the seemingly coincidental encounter</i>

556
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,080
<i>was actually a calculation</i>

557
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,960
<i>more sophisticated than a math problem.</i>

558
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
<i>The gifts
they mustered the courage to give</i>

559
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,960
<i>were cloaked in mischief.</i>

560
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,520
<i>They chose
to silently say in their hearts,</i>

561
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,680
<i>"I want you to be happy."</i>

562
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,280
<i>However, love would always
quietly slip out</i>

563
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,280
<i>in every glance at him</i>

564
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,320
<i>and secretly written</i>

565
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,800
<i>into a diary under a desk lamp.</i>

566
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,440
<i>These trivial and scrupulous moments</i>

567
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,360
<i>are like the candy
a child hides in their pocket.</i>

568
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,480
<i>If we unwrap the candy
and sniff it during the night,</i>

569
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,560
<i>the next day would seem</i>

570
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,280
<i>a little more worth anticipating.</i>

571
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,000
<i>Let's all relax</i>

572
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,640
<i>after such a long class.</i>

573
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,200
<i>Let's play a game of imitation.</i>

574
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
<i>We shall start with Guan Fang.</i>

575
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,080
<i>Each of you will imitate an animal.</i>

576
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,040
<i>Begin.</i>

577
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,240
<i>Hurry up.</i>

578
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,720
<i>Rangrang is cuter
than a kitty in every way.</i>

579
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,760
<i>No, to me,</i>

580
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,160
<i>he is even cuter than cute.</i>
