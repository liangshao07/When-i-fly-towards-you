00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,040
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

4
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,080
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,480
<i>I Have Someone Who Listens to My Problems.</i>

6
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,960
Are you not going back
to Suyang this year?

7
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,320
My uncle will be spending
the New Year alone in Jiangyi.

8
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,640
I told my parents

9
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,920
I will keep him company here.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
That's great.

11
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,600
We can hang out every day.

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,560
This is the fourth year
we've known each other,

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,880
but it's our first time
celebrating the New Year together.

14
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,080
It's snowing.

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,280
What are you doing?

16
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,560
Last year,
I made a wish when it was snowing

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
to be with you when it snows this year.

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,360
See? It came true.

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,000
So I'm making a wish for next year.

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,960
What did you wish for?

21
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,000
It won't come true if I say it out loud.

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,800
I'll tell you
when it comes true next year.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,720
Rangrang, look at me.

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,240
My eyes feel a bit cold.

25
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,360
This way, my eyes won't be cold.

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
But I can't see,

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,960
so you have to hold my hand.

28
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
<i>At some moment, I realized</i>

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,080
<i>how wonderful it is
to be in love in winter.</i>

30
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,240
Rangrang!

31
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,200
<i>The wind and snow
give us a great excuse to hug.</i>

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,200
<i>Thick coats can't hide
the warmth of our heartbeats.</i>

33
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,600
<i>Warming our hands
with the heat from roasted sweet potatoes</i>

34
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,960
<i>is an excuse
just to hold each other's hands.</i>

35
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,680
<i>In spring, we interlock our fingers</i>

36
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,400
-Rangrang!
<i>-through the long sleeves,</i>

37
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,920
<i>spending the time away lazily.</i>

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,760
<i>And that seems to be just fine.</i>

39
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,680
{\an8}<i>When summer rolls around,</i>

40
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,600
<i>it's a new summer.</i>

41
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,760
<i>Rangrang and I will start
to prepare for our internships.</i>

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,680
All the best.

43
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,520
<i>He studies aircraft manufacturing.</i>

44
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,960
<i>I don't know anything about that.</i>

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
<i>I thought it was</i>

46
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,080
<i>just about creating airplanes.</i>

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,840
<i>He says</i>

48
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,440
<i>flying is the most romantic pursuit
of humankind.</i>

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,560
<i>There is nothing cooler</i>

50
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,760
<i>than being a conductor of air currents.</i>

51
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,920
<i>He seems to glow</i>

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,160
<i>when he talks about this.</i>

53
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,200
<i>I suddenly realized</i>

54
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,880
<i>I couldn't let myself fall behind.</i>

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,840
<i>Sometimes, when I'm talking
to my friends on the phone,</i>

56
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,200
<i>I feel as if we're back</i>

57
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,560
<i>in high school again.</i>

58
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,880
<i>Jiang Jia passed the interview
for the television station.</i>

59
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,120
<i>She is about to become an intern reporter.</i>

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,480
<i>Way to go. That's cool.</i>

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,720
<i>Guan Fang is getting ready for graduation.</i>

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,960
<i>Why isn't the car here yet?</i>

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
<i>As for Gu Ran,</i>

64
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,280
<i>he seems to be getting ever busier</i>

65
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,600
<i>with his studies abroad.</i>

66
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,080
<i>He often misses our calls</i>

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,720
<i>due to the time difference.</i>

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,840
<i>Even when he shows up,</i>

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,840
<i>there are dark circles under his eyes.</i>

70
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,840
<i>It's really as we said in the beginning.</i>

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,080
<i>Everyone is shining in their own field.</i>

72
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,560
LOVE EAST CHINA,
TRAVEL FAR AND MAKE YOUR MARK

73
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,880
<i>The sycamore trees outside
flourishing once more</i>

74
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
<i>mark the long-awaited arrival</i>

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,320
<i>of our graduation day.</i>

76
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,560
-Let's see.
-Let me see.

77
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,160
Zaizai, are you sure
about going back to Jiangyi for work?

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,040
Yes, I'm going with my boyfriend.

79
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm jealous

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,600
that you guys get to live at home.

81
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,760
Jiangyi is huge.

82
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
My workplace isn't in the same area

83
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
as where my parents live.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,640
We plan on renting a place together.

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,440
How nice!

86
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,800
-I agree.
-Gather around!

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,840
-We'll head over first.
-Bye.

88
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,160
<i>Rangrang, we're going
to take graduation photos now.</i>

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,320
<i>You're probably still busy
at the office and can't make it.</i>

90
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,320
<i>I'll tell you a secret.</i>

91
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,360
<i>I look great in this outfit.</i>

92
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,880
<i>I'll send you more pictures.</i>

93
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,560
Zaizai.

94
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,200
Happy graduation.

95
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,240
Rangrang!

96
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,120
Why did you come back?

97
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
That's because you're happy.

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,080
You would want to share your joy.

99
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
That's why I'm here.

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,200
Gather around!

101
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,160
Wait here.

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,560
Zaizai.

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,040
Take this.

104
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,800
Hurry.

105
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,640
Look at the camera.

106
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,800
One, two, three.

107
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,160
-Happy graduation!
-Happy graduation!

108
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,680
I know you've been busy with graduation.

109
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,120
So I took it upon myself

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,480
to set all of this up.

111
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,080
See if there is anything you don't like.

112
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,440
How could I not like what you did

113
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,400
with the place?

114
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
I have it all thought out.

115
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,200
We'll put up our photos here.

116
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,280
Did you arrange all of this?

117
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,320
Do you want to rearrange anything?

118
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,440
I added all those things myself.

119
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,200
Once you move your stuff in,

120
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,240
this place will actually be our...

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,920
Home.

122
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
See if we need anything else.

123
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,760
I do think something is missing.

124
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,880
All right. That completes everything.

125
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,840
You seem to match my bed

126
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,800
so well.

127
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,080
I'll unpack your stuff.

128
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,640
Why are you running off?

129
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,560
Are you shy?

130
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,520
I tested the bed.

131
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,520
It's very soft.

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,200
Do you want to test it out tonight

133
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
with me...

134
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,160
Sure.

135
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,960
If you want to test it out,

136
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,200
why wait until tonight?

137
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,760
I was just kidding.

138
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,200
I'm serious.

139
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
This is it.

140
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,960
Let me make an introduction.

141
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,400
This is Su Zaizai,

142
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,280
our Data Department's
new intern translator.

143
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
Say hello.

144
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,920
Hello, everyone.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Nice to meet you.

146
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,400
Just call me Zaizai.

147
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

148
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,960
You can sit there.

149
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,880
Our new colleague

150
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,480
looks so young.

151
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes. Let's continue.

152
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,400
Go through this part again.

153
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,360
-And this part.
-Okay.

154
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
You sure know how to spruce things up.

155
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,680
My boyfriend says
to fill a new environment

156
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,480
with your own things

157
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,760
to have a sense of belonging.

158
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,200
Is there anything I can help with?

159
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,920
Translate this client's information.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,920
Okay.

161
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,880
-This.
-Okay.

162
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,760
<i>Rangrang, I'm getting off work!</i>

163
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,880
<i>I still need a while.</i>

164
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
<i>You can head home first.</i>

165
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,520
<i>If it gets too late, don't wait up for me.</i>

166
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,160
<i>Go to sleep early.</i>

167
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,280
<i>The temperature dropped today.</i>

168
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,600
<i>Remember to close the windows.</i>

169
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,080
All right. Good job today.

170
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,280
That's all for today.

171
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,080
We'll continue tomorrow. Get some rest.

172
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,280
-Okay.
-I'm off.

173
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,240
-Bye.
-Bye.

174
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,160
Bye.

175
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,800
Hey, beautiful.

176
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,560
Do you want to go to a cinema

177
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,440
and hold hands in the dark?

178
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm exhausted.

179
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,760
Let me recharge.

180
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,880
Rangrang,

181
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,960
why don't I tell you a joke?

182
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,000
I have a sweetheart.

183
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,240
His name is Rangrang.

184
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,280
But unlike his name,

185
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,040
he never rings.

186
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,480
We just came back from the cinema.

187
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,200
May I interview you, Mr. Zhang Lurang?

188
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,120
<i>How would you rate the movie we watched?</i>

189
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,120
<i>100 points.</i>

190
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,080
<i>Why?</i>

191
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,720
<i>The movie itself is 50 points,</i>

192
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,240
<i>but I'll give it 100 points</i>

193
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,920
<i>because of the person who sat beside me.</i>

194
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,360
<i>What pickup line book
has Rangrang been reading?</i>

195
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,600
<i>He has been so cheesy lately.</i>

196
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,520
<i>What are you saying?</i>

197
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,880
<i>I said that the temperature in Jiangyi</i>

198
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,600
<i>has been dropping fast.</i>

199
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,520
<i>It's cold.</i>

200
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,560
<i>Let's hurry home then.</i>

201
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,440
Are you almost all packed?

202
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,560
Well, you can have what I can't take.

203
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,480
-Then the limited-edition games...
-No.

204
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
I have a good buddy

205
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,800
who loves games.

206
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,400
I bet he hasn't played much without me.

207
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,040
I'm giving them to him when I get back.

208
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,240
You wrapped that ring
that you bought days ago so nicely.

209
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,560
Is that for your buddy too?

210
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,040
Either way, it's not for you.

211
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
I envy you.

212
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,680
I want to go home too.

213
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
Hot pot.

214
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
Sichuan fish with pickled greens.

215
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,080
Pork knuckles.

216
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,360
I'm hungry. I'm buying food.

217
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,360
Do you want any?

218
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,960
I'll pass. You can go ahead.

219
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,680
<i>Gu Ran!</i>

220
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,000
<i>-Hello!
-Gu Ran, you're still up!</i>

221
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,440
<i>Guan Fang is back in Jiangyi too,</i>

222
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,880
<i>so I figured I would try my luck.</i>

223
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,520
<i>Finally, we all made it to the video call.</i>

224
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,360
Those two are usually absent.

225
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,960
I always make it on time.

226
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,800
Well, I'm packing right now.

227
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,120
<i>Are you coming back soon?</i>

228
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,400
<i>Are you coming back?</i>

229
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,600
<i>When? Do you want me to pick you up?</i>

230
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
In a few days,

231
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,440
after I settle everything here.

232
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Don't pick me up. I don't have much stuff.

233
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,680
<i>Okay.</i>

234
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,160
<i>Jiangjiang, are you working?</i>

235
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Yes.

236
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
I made an appointment
with the interviewee.

237
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
I'm waiting here for them.

238
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,480
{\an8}PRESS PASS

239
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,240
{\an8}Winter is so cold this year.

240
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,480
{\an8}It's colder than last year.

241
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,880
<i>I'm going to be here until night.</i>

242
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,440
<i>I should've worn more layers.</i>

243
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,800
Are you near Tianmen Bridge?

244
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,480
<i>Your background looks so familiar.</i>

245
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
I'm right outside the Garden Community.

246
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,120
We often passed by here in high school.

247
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,320
<i>We're almost at our stop.</i>

248
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,360
<i>We have to go.</i>

249
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,600
<i>You guys carry on. Bye!</i>

250
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,400
<i>We'll get together when you get back.</i>

251
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,320
<i>Bye!</i>

252
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,280
{\an8}Those two mushy lovers.

253
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,680
<i>I need to go too.</i>

254
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,880
<i>I need to help my grandma
buy some meat for the shop.</i>

255
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,880
<i>It's urgent.</i>

256
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,360
<i>I'm hanging up. Bye.</i>

257
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
Hey, don't hang up yet.

258
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,320
We want to see her too.

259
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,400
Are you going to tell me

260
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,640
you need to hang up too?

261
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,560
I do have work.

262
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,960
You're so busy. It's good to be busy.

263
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,800
<i>I'll be all right,</i>

264
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,400
<i>all alone in a foreign country.</i>

265
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,839
<i>It's fine.</i>

266
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,680
But I do have some time to spare.

267
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,640
<i>You're not leaving again</i>

268
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
<i>after coming back, are you?</i>

269
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,520
No, I'll stay in Jiangyi
to continue my graduate studies.

270
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,280
Then I guess

271
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,960
we'll be seeing each other a lot.

272
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,480
<i>Jiang Jia, come here.</i>

273
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,520
<i>Okay.</i>

274
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,200
I need to get back to work.
I'm hanging up. Bye.

275
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,240
Jiang Jia,

276
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,560
did the interviewee tell you
how much longer they will be?

277
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,480
Let me check.

278
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,840
They're stuck in traffic.

279
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,120
They need another half an hour.

280
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,480
A delivery?

281
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,240
I didn't order anything.

282
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,560
Well, it's for me,

283
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,680
but the kind stranger didn't leave a name.

284
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll enjoy it then.

285
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,480
Things will be lively in Jiangyi

286
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,440
after Gu Ran comes back.

287
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,880
In high school,

288
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,240
he and Jiangjiang used to fight

289
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,800
every time they saw each other.

290
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,960
After so many years apart,

291
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,400
they should get along better now.

292
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,640
I think they're actually rather close.

293
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Really? Why?

294
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,600
Intuition.

295
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,520
Su Zaizai?

296
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,400
It really is you!

297
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,760
I thought I got the wrong person.

298
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,560
Wang Nan?

299
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
You've become more handsome.

300
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,280
Why are you back?

301
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm on vacation.

302
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,800
Are you two...

303
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,160
It is exactly what you think.

304
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
Nice going.

305
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,400
-Wang Nan. Come on.
-Yes?

306
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,960
I have to go. Let's talk again soon.

307
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,920
-Bye.
-Bye.

308
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,920
Bye.

309
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,840
Rangrang, you remember him, right?

310
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,280
Yes.

311
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,400
"Handsome," right?

312
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,560
I can't believe you still remember
such a tiny detail.

313
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,400
I've nearly forgotten.

314
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,040
Be honest.

315
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,560
Had you already fallen for me
at that time?

316
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,440
No.

317
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,000
Rangrang, it's super obvious when you lie.

318
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
But you still won't admit it.

319
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,280
Tell me. Was it back then?

320
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
No.

321
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,560
Was it? I bet it was.

322
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,680
<i>Huo, Huo, Huo</i>

323
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,840
<i>The Huos' martial art fist forms are agile</i>

324
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,800
<i>Huo, Huo, Huo</i>

325
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,680
<i>When we strike, no one can escape</i>

326
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
<i>Huo, Huo, Huo</i>

327
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,960
<i>Life flows by in the small town</i>

328
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,760
<i>The courage is still clear</i>

329
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,600
<i>Our true memories</i>

330
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,040
<i>I still remember you</i>

331
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,880
<i>Live on proudly</i>

332
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,800
How long has it been since we last met up?

333
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,840
We can do it more often
now that we're all in Jiangyi.

334
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,880
I heard you got an offer

335
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,200
from a company in Yong'an.

336
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,600
-Are you not taking it?
-I'm not.

337
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm young.

338
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,680
I'll have plenty of opportunities.

339
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,880
But right now,

340
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,720
I want to spend more time with my grandma.

341
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,920
Jiangyi is good, isn't it?

342
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,960
You guys are here.

343
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,960
Why are we talking about this?

344
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
We're charged by the hour.

345
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,280
Let's keep singing.

346
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,400
Come on!

347
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,880
<i>-Staying up all night
-Staying up all night</i>

348
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,240
<i>-Talking with you until our livers explode
-Talking with you until our livers explode</i>

349
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,280
<i>-Shopping with you
-Shopping with you</i>

350
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,360
<i>-Till our feet turn flat
-Till our feet turn flat</i>

351
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,400
<i>-Thank you so much
-Thank you so much</i>

352
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,440
<i>-For making me live again
-For making me live again</i>

353
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,480
<i>-Letting me know once again L, O, V, E
-Letting me know once again L, O, V, E</i>

354
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,360
<i>-L, O, V, E
-L, O, V, E</i>

355
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,720
-Come on. Let's drink.
-Cheers.

356
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,440
{\an8}-Cheers.
-Cheers.

357
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,960
Can Su Zaizai handle her liquor?

358
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,160
Aren't you going to stop her?

359
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,360
She's enjoying herself. Let her be.

360
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,040
Keep drinking.

361
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,360
-One more.
-No.

362
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,360
How much did they drink?

363
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,920
I swear they only had one glass each.

364
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,720
I didn't know they were such lightweights.

365
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,360
I don't think

366
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,240
she knows it herself.

367
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,880
What's wrong?

368
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,600
I feel awful.

369
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,720
Do you feel awful?

370
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Does your stomach hurt?

371
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,240
My head hurts.

372
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,600
My feet hurt too.

373
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,520
My fingernails hurt too.

374
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,640
I want a hug.

375
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,840
Rangrang.

376
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,160
Rangrang.

377
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,360
It's raw.

378
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,800
I'm never letting you drink again.

379
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
Shoot. I'm going to be late.

380
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,320
Why don't I give you a ride?

381
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,240
It's okay, Rangrang.

382
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,240
The company will pick me up. I'm off.

383
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Zaizai.

384
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,320
Did you forget something?

385
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,880
You're making me shy.

386
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Fine.

387
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,880
I'm off.

388
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,440
After working on this project for so long,

389
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,680
it's finally coming to an end.

390
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,720
Zhang Lurang,

391
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,120
are you going to today's gathering
that Xiaochen mentioned?

392
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
What gathering?

393
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,280
It's actually a group blind date.

394
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,600
Our department has the most singles.

395
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,880
So we contacted the Testing Department

396
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,200
and arranged a dinner gathering.

397
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,480
I'll pass.

398
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,640
We know you have a girlfriend.

399
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,360
Think of it as making new friends.

400
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,160
My girlfriend is away on a work trip.

401
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,440
I need to go home and call her.

402
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,960
Your girlfriend is clingy.

403
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,800
Actually, I'm the clingy one.

404
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,320
All right.

405
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,400
Okay, I'll be leaving first.

406
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,720
You guys go ahead.

407
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,720
Enjoy your weekend.

408
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,920
-Enjoy your weekend.
-Bye.

409
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,960
-Bye.
-Bye.

410
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,160
Countless girls in our company have tried

411
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,880
to get his contact information.

412
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,520
But I've never even seen him waver once.

413
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,040
Also, he always
talks about his girlfriend.

414
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,960
Now I'm really curious

415
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,640
about how his girlfriend looks.

416
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,560
Given Zhang Lurang's personality,

417
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,960
his girlfriend should be

418
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,280
gentle and generous.

419
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,680
Kind and understanding.

420
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,520
Fair and quiet.

421
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,960
<i>Rangrang!</i>

422
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,600
Guess who I ran into.

423
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,280
I passed by the China World Trade Center.

424
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,840
There is an event going on.

425
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,480
The guest is the star in the movie
we watched a few days ago.

426
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,640
Do you remember?

427
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,800
The actor that I said
looks a lot like Guan Fang.

428
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,960
He is even taller in person.

429
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,960
Did you get a photo with him?

430
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,960
<i>No, I was in a hurry.</i>

431
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,160
<i>By the way, Rangrang,</i>

432
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,480
<i>if I open the curtains,</i>

433
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,600
<i>I can see the sea from my hotel room.</i>

434
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,840
<i>The view is spectacular.</i>

435
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,800
Let's stay in this hotel if we come here.

436
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Sure.

437
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,240
<i>There's also
a really good rice noodle shop downstairs.</i>

438
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,280
How does it compare to the place
we frequented in university?

439
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,160
The one near the university is better.

440
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,400
Rangrang,

441
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,760
it's almost time
for my appointment with the client.

442
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,200
I'm kind of nervous.

443
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,880
<i>Is it because
it is your first time meeting a client?</i>

444
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,840
I'm afraid I'll say
the wrong thing when I get nervous.

445
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,760
You'll be fine.

446
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,160
Think about
your first autonomous admission interview,

447
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,480
<i>your debate
in your third year of university,</i>

448
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,040
<i>and your interview with the company.</i>

449
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,000
You were nervous,

450
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,480
but you did well.

451
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,960
<i>You're amazing, Zaizai.</i>

452
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,880
It's amazing that suddenly,
I'm not so nervous anymore.

453
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,280
But I'm a little hungry.

454
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,720
Hungry?

455
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,000
Yes.

456
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,360
We're having dinner
with the partner company.

457
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,120
I heard we'll be having local delicacies,

458
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,960
so I didn't eat much for lunch.

459
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,400
Zaizai, it's time to go.

460
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,800
I'm coming.

461
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,000
Rangrang, I'm hanging up.

462
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,480
Okay, bye. You've got this.

463
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,960
I didn't expect it

464
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,280
to go so smoothly.

465
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,520
I've been working
with this British company

466
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,840
for so many years.

467
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,520
This is the first time

468
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,480
the contract signing went so quickly.

469
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,440
Yes.

470
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,280
It's all thanks
to your connections, Mr. Wei.

471
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,480
Otherwise, negotiations
would have lasted for months.

472
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,800
Here, let me give you a toast, Mr. Wei.

473
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,760
There is no rush.

474
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,280
What you said is not entirely correct.

475
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,320
I think

476
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,320
Ms. Su's fluent translation

477
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,640
was a great help.

478
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,840
Ms. Su is so young

479
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,960
and beautiful.

480
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,640
I didn't expect her professionalism
to be at such a high level.

481
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
I just graduated.

482
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,920
It's all thanks to Mr. Chen's guidance.

483
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,600
Isn't it a little cold in here?

484
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,040
I don't think so.

485
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,920
I might be more sensitive to the cold.

486
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,520
Ms. Su,

487
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,640
the wine here is very nice.

488
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,160
Would you like to try some?

489
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,680
How can anyone leave wine in their glass?

490
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,160
Mr. Wei, I'm not good
at holding my liquor.

491
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,320
I ramble when I get drunk.

492
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,520
I wouldn't want
to say something inappropriate

493
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,640
in front of everyone.

494
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,480
But I appreciate your recognition.

495
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,120
Why don't I toast you with tea instead?

496
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
No, don't.

497
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,880
You make it seem

498
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,280
as if I'm imposing on you.

499
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,640
Hurry up
and thank Mr. Wei for understanding.

500
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,920
Thank you for your understanding.

501
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,320
Ms. Su,

502
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,480
you don't have to drink the wine,

503
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,880
but the food here

504
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,160
is delicious.

505
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,240
Here.

506
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,560
Thank you, Mr. Wei. I'm not hungry.

507
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,920
She's not hungry.

508
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,040
Ms. Su, since you aren't hungry,

509
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
you can go outside and enjoy the view
while we finish our meal.

510
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,400
The view here is wonderful.

511
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,080
-Here.
-Yes.

512
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,160
<i>On this night with an empty stomach,</i>

513
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,600
<i>how I wish someone could come</i>

514
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,560
<i>and take me away from here.</i>
