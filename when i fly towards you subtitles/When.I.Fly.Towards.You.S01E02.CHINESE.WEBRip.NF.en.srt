00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,760
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

2
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

3
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,960
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,160
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,000
<i>I Like It When You Frown</i>

6
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,840
<i>and Call Me Coward.</i>

7
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,200
So did you get back so quickly

8
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,360
because you took a shortcut?

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,800
How did you know about the shortcut?

10
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,720
Luckily, I was smart

11
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,360
and checked gossip posts
about military training in advance.

12
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,080
Did you check? How?

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Look. I preserved this last precious item.

14
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,640
You are really something, Su Zaizai.

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,960
Is everyone here?

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
-Hurry.
-Assemble.

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,120
All of you, conduct a check

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,240
for any prohibited items.

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,920
This is your last chance.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
If I find something...

21
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Ma'am, I have something to hand in.

22
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,480
I feel that it's wrong to hide snacks.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
So I've decided to hand in my chocolate.

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,360
Hey, buddy.

25
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,880
{\an8}How about a bag of chips

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
{\an8}for an hour on your PSP?

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
You can get an hour
with barbecue-flavored chips.

28
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
But tomato-flavored?

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,880
Half an hour tops.

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Take it out.

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,400
Wait, why is there a surprise inspection?

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,760
Go now.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,080
Hey, where are you going?

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,080
Sir, I heard that we must fold our quilts

35
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,240
into cubes.

36
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,520
-Stop.
-I don't know how to do it.

37
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,440
Stop right there.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,280
Hurry.

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,760
Go quickly.

40
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,040
Mr. Fang is behind me.

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Go now.

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,440
The boy in front.

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,040
I told you to stop. Didn't you hear me?

44
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,160
Mr. Fang.

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,720
Where is it?

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,200
What?

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
Do you mean this herbal syrup?

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Do you want some?

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,600
Please just leave it

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,480
at the fire hydrant by the door.

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,200
It contains anime merchandise.

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,000
My parents mustn't know about this.

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,960
All right then.

54
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,800
That's it. Thank you, sir.

55
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Bye.

56
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,440
You...

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,080
Are you...

58
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,520
Mr. Fang!

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,440
Someone passed out in our dorm!

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,880
I'm coming.

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
He left.

62
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,800
I said the instructor had left.

63
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,520
Don't tell me you are feeling shy.

64
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,040
No.

65
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,000
There is dust on you.

66
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,480
Let's get out of here.

67
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,760
Hurry. The instructor is coming.

68
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,920
The instructor is coming.

69
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,640
What's wrong?

70
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,920
Mr. Fang.

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,880
I have low...

72
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,120
Low blood pressure.

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,040
Low blood sugar.

74
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
Mr. Fang,

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,720
I have low blood sugar.

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
Could you please

77
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,040
buy a piece of chocolate for me?

78
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,600
Ferrero will do.

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
Low blood sugar, is it?

80
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,880
Chocolate is unnecessary.

81
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,880
I have a secret remedy.

82
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,280
What secret remedy?

83
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,240
I think we can save the trouble.

84
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,160
You should sweat and strengthen your body.

85
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,120
What?

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,840
That is to say,

87
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,440
you will clean the office

88
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,520
{\an8}after the training tomorrow.

89
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,960
{\an8}You can't join the singing contest

90
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,280
{\an8}until you clean it.

91
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Do you understand?

92
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,040
Ranran,

93
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,840
the wallet you found on campus yesterday

94
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,360
was actually mine.

95
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,400
Thank you so much.

96
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,920
What did you call me?

97
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
Ranran.

98
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,200
A nickname for Gu Ran.

99
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,320
It's friendly to use nicknames.

100
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,840
My new friends in my class

101
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,400
already call me Zaizai.

102
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,520
By the way,

103
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,200
are you close with Zhang Lurang,

104
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,880
who is in your class?

105
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,000
Just so-so.

106
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,760
I see.

107
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,760
Then are you two friends?

108
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,720
Or did you two just meet?

109
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,120
We've known each other since birth.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,600
That's a long time.

111
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,600
Then you must know him well.

112
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,400
Yes.

113
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,360
But I think...

114
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,760
I'll just be honest with you, Ranran.

115
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,560
Zhang Lurang was late yesterday

116
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,240
and pretended to be from our class.

117
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,680
He's not honest at all.

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,520
I think he's problematic.

119
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,440
Is that so?

120
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,760
Yes, I saw it with my eyes.

121
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,160
By the way, Ranran,

122
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,440
do you know that you are famous?

123
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,360
But Zhang Lurang is the most popular

124
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,800
in the online forum.

125
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,400
I don't agree with that.

126
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,120
Were you hiding

127
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,120
because you kept your phone too?

128
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,200
This.

129
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,680
Let me keep it for you.

130
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,440
I'll keep this and my phone

131
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,680
in the cabinet.

132
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,800
I assure you it's safe.

133
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,200
We don't have strict inspections

134
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,320
in the girls' dorms.

135
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,280
Don't worry. I'll keep it safe.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,040
Thank you,

137
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,680
Su Zaizai.

138
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,320
He knows my name!

139
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,480
Don't bother looking.

140
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,120
You're staying until you finish cleaning.

141
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,120
Sir.

142
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,880
Come in.

143
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,920
Go away.

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,600
You stepped on my foot.

145
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,000
Sir,

146
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,920
the singing contest is about to start.

147
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,760
Can they...

148
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,160
Sir, the singing contest
is a group activity.

149
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,160
We must join.

150
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,840
Yes, we're team players.

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,120
What did I just tell you?

152
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,200
We can't leave until we're done.

153
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,080
Sir, can Zhang Lurang help us

154
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,560
clean the office?

155
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,240
It will take forever

156
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,960
if it's just the two of us.

157
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,640
Are you willing to do it?

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,880
I...

159
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,720
Lurang.

160
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,480
I...

161
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,640
I'll do it.

162
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,800
<i>Everyone, we have ten minutes left.</i>

163
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,720
I just discussed this with Ms. Zhang.

164
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,400
We'll have an individual match

165
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,800
with Class 1.

166
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,920
Which of you would like to sing?

167
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,800
Singing in front of everyone?

168
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,120
That would be so awkward.

169
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
I won't do it.

170
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,040
Does no one want to sing?

171
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,640
You are already in high school.

172
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,360
Why are you still so shy?

173
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
Does nobody want to volunteer

174
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
and set a good example?

175
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,760
No?

176
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,200
Say my name.

177
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,160
What?

178
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,200
I want to sing. Say my name.

179
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,160
Su Zaizai!

180
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,720
-Su Zaizai!
-Su Zaizai!

181
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,800
-Su Zaizai!
-Su Zaizai!

182
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,240
-Su Zaizai!
-Su Zaizai!

183
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,680
I feel so shy about it.

184
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,360
Then I'll sing a song.

185
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,080
I'm going to sing "Secret."

186
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,800
This song

187
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,520
is for Gu Ran in Class 1.

188
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,160
What's happening?

189
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,120
A girl from Class 9 wants to sing for you.

190
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,440
And it's "Secret."

191
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,160
This is not much of a secret, is it?

192
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,840
Gu Ran, sing along.

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,400
-Gu Ran, join in!
-Gu Ran, join in!

194
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,320
-Gu Ran, join in!
-Gu Ran, join in!

195
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Why are you still sitting here? Stand up.

196
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,680
Well, she made the first move, right?

197
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,920
I shouldn't reject her.

198
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
I guess

199
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,160
I'll sing along.

200
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,960
Is he Gu Ran?

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,280
Where should we start singing?

202
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,480
It's pouring now.

203
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,880
Let's shelter from the rain first.

204
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,760
Wait, don't go.

205
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,440
Let me sing first.

206
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,680
-Zaizai, let's go.
-Don't go yet.

207
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,800
I got the wrong person.

208
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,600
-Let me sing first.
-His name isn't Gu Ran.

209
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,280
Forget about it. It's raining. Let's go.

210
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
-Hey, Zaizai!
-Let me sing.

211
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,520
Come on.

212
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,960
It's raining so heavily.

213
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,520
Gu Ran?

214
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,520
Is that your name?

215
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,720
You already know that.

216
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,920
There's no need to pretend.

217
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,560
What a coincidence.

218
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,600
The rain.

219
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,360
The shelter.

220
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,120
An encounter.

221
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,240
A secret.

222
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,280
It was planned out.

223
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,760
Meticulously planned out.

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,200
You...

225
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,400
Did you do it on purpose?

226
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,040
What?

227
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,680
It's so obvious.

228
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,680
There are so many people. How did I...

229
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,920
I already told you.

230
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,400
I can tell.

231
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,920
You want to take advantage of me.

232
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,320
It's so obvious.

233
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
Hey.

234
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,360
Since you left, don't come back in.

235
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,480
There is no space left.

236
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,520
-That's right.
-Return to your dorm now.

237
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,720
Wait, I was there just now.

238
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,320
I get it now.

239
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,800
You are feeling shy, aren't you?

240
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,760
I'm leaving.

241
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,920
Zhang Lurang.

242
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,920
Sorry, I...

243
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,080
So his name is Zhang Lurang.

244
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,720
The person I encountered in the rain,

245
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,720
met under the stairs, and wanted to know

246
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,040
has always been Zhang Lurang.

247
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,760
But I kept calling him Ranran.

248
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,880
He must think I'm an idiot.

249
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,400
Don't worry.

250
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,680
Zhang Lurang seems reasonable,

251
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,760
unlike Gu Ran.

252
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,720
Actually, it's all Gu Ran's fault.

253
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,760
If he hadn't pretended to be Zhang Lurang,

254
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,560
we wouldn't have made such a mistake.

255
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,800
I already got it wrong.

256
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,080
What should I do?

257
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,360
We happen to be standing guard soon.

258
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Why don't you ask him out and explain?

259
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,200
Gu Ran is with him.

260
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,800
Leave him to me.

261
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,960
Name a time and I'll bury him in advance.

262
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm sure he won't want to see me.

263
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,600
That's not true.

264
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,520
I'll arrange the storyline for you.

265
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,640
When you first saw Zhang Lurang,

266
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,600
did you call him an idiot for no reason?

267
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,080
When you two left from under the stairs,

268
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,720
did you call him out

269
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,000
and say he was problematic?

270
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,400
Yes.

271
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,400
There you go.

272
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,359
Think about it.

273
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,560
If someone repeatedly insulted you,

274
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,720
would you put up with it?

275
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,720
You would be eager to see this person

276
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,960
and scold them to their face.

277
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,280
How did you know he scolded me?

278
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,599
What?

279
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,560
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,400
-Just now, I...
-Zhang Lurang.

281
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,119
Come on. This way.

282
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,680
Run if it's raining.

283
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,680
Idiot.

284
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Maybe he was praising you.

285
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,760
It's okay.

286
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,480
Jiangjiang, this is so scary.

287
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,760
The instructor said

288
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,840
this base had been abandoned for years.

289
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,000
I guess so.

290
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,720
I don't know if anyone has been

291
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,320
to the location that we're guarding.

292
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,440
The grass is so messy.

293
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,040
There isn't even a light.

294
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,600
Jiangjiang.

295
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,080
I think I heard a baby crying.

296
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,240
Zaizai, it's all your imagination.

297
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,720
It's not that scary.

298
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,040
How about this, Zaizai?

299
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,400
I'll fetch two flashlights
from the equipment room.

300
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,320
You'll feel more secure with a light.

301
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,760
Then I'll go with you.

302
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,920
One of us has to be here

303
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,320
so we can explain

304
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,840
if an instructor checks on us.

305
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,160
All right.

306
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,520
How about this?

307
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
I'll teach you how not to be afraid.

308
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
How?

309
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,280
Clear all the random thoughts

310
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,600
from your mind.

311
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,080
Just bear one thing in mind.

312
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
Building 1 is up ahead.

313
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,640
In front of Building 1

314
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,320
is Zhang Lurang.

315
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,520
I feel a little cold.

316
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,880
It's warmer if we stand closer.

317
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,120
It's summer right now.

318
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,080
I feel cold in my heart.

319
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,160
Are you scared?

320
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,280
Nonsense!

321
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,960
That's for kids.

322
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,440
Lurang.

323
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,120
I think there is something weird

324
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,720
about this base.

325
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,120
The power went out.

326
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,000
Wait. Where are you going?

327
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,560
I'll get flashlights
from the equipment room.

328
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,080
Let's go. I'll go with you.

329
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,840
Then you go.

330
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
What's wrong?

331
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Are you afraid to go?

332
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,920
What? Me?

333
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,960
Stop kidding.

334
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,960
I used to watch horror movies

335
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,320
to fall asleep.

336
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,920
Let me tell you.

337
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,560
I can calmly finish three math papers

338
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,320
in a haunted house.

339
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,640
Don't be ridiculous.

340
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,520
I'm going.

341
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,760
I'm really going.

342
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,120
Don't be afraid. I'll be right back.

343
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,920
Zhang Lurang.

344
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,240
Good evening.

345
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,400
Are you not calling me Ranran anymore?

346
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,760
That was a misunderstanding.

347
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,920
Are you here alone?

348
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Do you need me to protect you?

349
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,720
Are you sure?

350
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
Behind you.

351
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,000
Behind me?

352
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,200
What is it?

353
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,320
I'm afraid to look!

354
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,120
It's a leaf.

355
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,440
A leaf.

356
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,200
Didn't you say you would protect me?

357
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,560
We can protect each other.

358
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,920
It's quite windy tonight, isn't it?

359
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,240
I brought the PSP

360
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,400
that you asked me to keep.

361
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,360
Here.

362
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,360
Thank you.

363
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,320
You're welcome.

364
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,360
I also have to apologize to you.

365
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,200
I previously called you an idiot

366
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,480
at the corner store.

367
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
Sorry for that.

368
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,200
It's all right.

369
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,440
That won't do.

370
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,120
I learn from my mistakes.

371
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,640
Anyway, I also called you an idiot.

372
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,840
You did a good job.

373
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,320
I think you are so courageous

374
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,640
when you scold others.

375
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,520
I see.

376
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,640
Do you know it's emotional abuse

377
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,320
to respond so brusquely?

378
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,240
How can you bear treating me like this?

379
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,960
Classmates should be friendly.

380
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,680
STORAGE ROOM

381
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,760
STORAGE ROOM

382
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,960
Is this the equipment room?

383
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
What happened?

384
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,680
Don't joke with me.

385
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,160
I just got locked inside.

386
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,960
It's not scary at all.

387
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,240
The wind

388
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,640
is quite strong.

389
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,360
Luckily, I was the one who came here.

390
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,440
If it were Zhang Lurang,

391
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,960
he would be scared to death.

392
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,640
Hey!

393
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,160
Is anyone outside?

394
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm locked inside!

395
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,600
Is anybody there?

396
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,400
Hello?

397
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
Is anybody there?

398
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,320
Is anybody there?

399
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,000
What was that sound?

400
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,400
STORAGE ROOM

401
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,760
STORAGE ROOM

402
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,760
Nobody is inside.

403
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,160
Hey, shine that somewhere else!

404
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,120
I'm a living person.

405
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,440
Who are you?

406
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,480
I'm a new student

407
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,480
in military training.

408
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,400
I got locked inside.

409
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,440
-It's you.
-It's you.

410
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
Why isn't she back yet?

411
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,680
It has been a while since my friend
went to the equipment room.

412
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,240
I wonder if something happened.

413
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,720
I want to go and look for her.

414
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,600
The equipment room?

415
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,480
Are you going alone?

416
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,080
Yes.

417
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,040
But if I leave you alone here,

418
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,240
will you be okay?

419
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,520
Will you be afraid?

420
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,120
It's okay.

421
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,840
I'll be right back. Wait for me here.

422
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,600
Do you want me to get you out?

423
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,920
Fine. Give me a reason.

424
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,760
If you can convince me, I'll save you.

425
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,920
Okay, fine.

426
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,640
I'll give you my QQ number when I get out.

427
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
All right?

428
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
Are you out of your mind?

429
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,880
Then what else do you want?

430
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,200
I'm a man of principles.

431
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,360
Please just help me.

432
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,200
Since we've met, it must be fate,

433
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,120
right?

434
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,600
Hey, don't go!

435
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,280
Should I break in with my hands

436
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,520
if I don't call for help?

437
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,440
Or could it be

438
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,800
that you are afraid?

439
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,440
I'm afraid?

440
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,360
Impossible.

441
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,600
Just go.

442
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
It's pretty dark up ahead.

443
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,800
If you are afraid, you can call my name.

444
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,440
My name will give you power.

445
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,720
Hey!

446
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,960
Wait a second.

447
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,760
I suddenly remembered something.

448
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,640
What if you don't come back?

449
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
If you leave now,

450
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,200
I'll tell others you locked me up

451
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,800
once I get out.

452
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,880
How can you be so shameless?

453
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,880
I was born like this.

454
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,440
How about this?

455
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,720
Stay here for a while.

456
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,360
When the instructor comes by for a patrol,

457
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,840
he will save us.

458
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,520
Save you, not me, okay?

459
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,360
I can't believe you.

460
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,640
Your name is Jiang Jia, right?

461
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,640
So what?

462
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,520
Jiang Jia.

463
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,800
What now?

464
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,640
Nothing.

465
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,280
I'm just making sure you're still here.

466
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,640
I don't think someone will come.

467
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,840
I should find someone

468
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,240
to open the door.

469
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,280
Hey!

470
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,480
I suddenly remember

471
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
that the door isn't firmly locked.

472
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,040
Why don't you try to break it open?

473
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,680
Break it open?

474
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,720
Yes.

475
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,600
It's possible though.

476
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,080
But I'm a girl.

477
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,720
It may be too much for me

478
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,880
to break the door open.

479
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,880
If I don't get anything out of this,

480
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
it might be...

481
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,880
Tell me.

482
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,240
I haven't decided yet. You owe me one.

483
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,160
Okay.

484
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,080
Deal.

485
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,440
A kind reminder.

486
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,920
Step back.

487
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,840
Hey.

488
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,000
If you can't do it, why don't you...

489
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,840
It hurts so much.

490
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,480
I don't believe it.

491
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,160
Forget it, all right?

492
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,080
Step back!

493
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,760
Why don't we just...

494
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,160
Let's go.

495
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,080
Okay.

496
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,560
Who is it?

497
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,200
I won't turn around.

498
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,480
I will never turn around.

499
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,840
Please!

500
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,280
Don't catch me!

501
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,520
Su Zaizai.

502
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Please spare me!

503
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,840
It's me.

504
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,800
Zhang Lurang, I ran into a ghost.

505
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,000
I ran into something as well.

506
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,400
A coward.

507
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,320
So it's a cat.

508
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,080
I thought it was a ghost.

509
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,200
Well, I'm not a coward.

510
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,600
I'm usually brave.

511
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,080
Just now, I...

512
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,040
That was to blame.

513
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,960
Zaizai,

514
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,160
why are you guys here?

515
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,520
I was about to go and look for you.

516
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,760
I thought something happened to you.

517
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,480
What would happen to me?

518
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,480
-Gu Ran just...
-Hey!

519
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,000
The instructor will check on us soon.
Let's go.

520
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,960
Hurry.

521
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,520
I'll tell you when we get back.

522
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,320
How much longer do we have to stand here?

523
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,840
The instructor might not notice

524
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,200
if one of us is missing.

525
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,200
That's possible.

526
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,360
But I'll report you if you leave.

527
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,880
The instructor might let me leave

528
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,400
after seeing how impartial I am.

529
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,800
Gu Ran, Zhang Lurang.

530
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,160
Is it cooked?

531
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,360
I don't think so.

532
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,080
We can eat it if it's soft.

533
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,600
It's hot.

534
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,360
I wish it were cooked already.

535
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,800
I bought these from an old man

536
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,680
selling roasted sweet potatoes
beyond the fence.

537
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,920
He was about to leave.

538
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Only raw ones were left.

539
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,360
It's edible at least. Don't be so picky.

540
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,680
{\an8}Will these cicadas

541
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,120
ever cease chirping?

542
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,240
How did they offend you by chirping?

543
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,520
I've been holding a grudge against them

544
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,040
since I was little.

545
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,040
At that time,

546
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,480
I was about five or six years old.

547
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,160
I was tricked
into catching a jar full of cicadas,

548
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,880
only to find out
those were all cockroaches.

549
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,160
Who was so mischievous?

550
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,840
He's sitting right next to you.

551
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,800
Did you really do that?

552
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,360
I don't remember.

553
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,920
I feel

554
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,200
that all those fun things in our childhood

555
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,160
are gone.

556
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
I agree.

557
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,040
I used to see fireflies all the time.

558
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,280
Zhang Lurang,

559
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,120
what did you do for fun as a kid?

560
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,360
Study.

561
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,640
His family is strict with him.

562
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,000
It always took me a lot of effort

563
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,800
to get him out of his house.

564
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
I see.

565
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,760
The moon tonight

566
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,000
is beautiful.

567
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,960
Is it any different?

568
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,880
It's different.

569
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,679
Zhang Lurang, what do you think?

570
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,960
Yes.

571
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,920
What are you doing?

572
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,360
Let's go. Quick!

573
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,679
-Hurry, go.
-Hurry.

574
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,280
Don't run. Stop!

575
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,400
<i>My biggest gain</i>

576
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,280
<i>from the military training that year</i>

577
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,280
<i>is that I seem</i>

578
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,600
<i>to be less afraid of ghosts.</i>

579
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,360
<i>Maybe it is</i>

580
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,240
<i>because a quiet and arrogant guy</i>

581
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,880
<i>came into my heart</i>

582
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,080
<i>and wouldn't leave.</i>

583
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,440
<i>This is how things work in the world.</i>

584
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,760
<i>Beyond the mountains is the sea.</i>

585
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,560
<i>At the end of the night is light.</i>

586
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,440
{\an8}UNYIELDING, COURAGE, STRENGTH

587
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,920
{\an8}<i>Things that are not so cute</i>

588
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,400
<i>may leave a print in your memory</i>

589
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,920
<i>when you turn around.</i>

590
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,040
<i>Adults always say</i>

591
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,200
<i>there are too many uncertainties in youth.</i>

592
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,240
{\an8}<i>But it's because of these uncertainties,</i>

593
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,400
{\an8}<i>which may bring us surprises or horrors,</i>

594
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,720
{\an8}<i>that we would</i>

595
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,480
<i>look forward to every new day</i>

596
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,120
<i>as we never did before</i>

597
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,800
<i>at the age of 16.</i>

598
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,680
<i>This is the last day that we stand guard.</i>

599
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,840
{\an8}<i>I don't think he will notice</i>

600
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,520
{\an8}<i>if I include him in the shot.</i>

601
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,000
<i>Who is there?</i>

602
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,000
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

603
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,880
<i>I'm not a coward.</i>

604
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,160
<i>At least when I stand before you,</i>

605
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,640
<i>I'm the bravest one.</i>
