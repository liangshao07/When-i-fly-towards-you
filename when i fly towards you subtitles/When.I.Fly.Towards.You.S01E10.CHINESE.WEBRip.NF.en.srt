00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,040
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

4
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,200
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,960
<i>On Doomsday, I Want to Tell You...</i>

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,200
Over here.

7
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,000
Let me help you.

8
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,120
Let me help you.

9
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,920
What did you pack in here? It's so heavy.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,920
Just some souvenirs.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,320
{\an8}Be careful. Don't break anything.

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,800
Will we be arriving after 12 a.m.?

13
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,800
Yes.

14
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,920
Have you forgotten

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,280
what today's date is?

16
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,160
It's the 20th today.

17
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,680
After midnight, it's doomsday!

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,120
Is it really doomsday today?

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,920
Suddenly, I feel

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,760
that this train ride is different.

21
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,360
What are you doing?

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,280
Texting my grandma

23
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
to tell her it's doomsday today.

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,840
{\an8}Our fate
as grandparent-grandchild ends here.

25
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,440
In the next life,
I want to be her grandson again.

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Did she reply to you?

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,720
Yes.

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,760
What did she say?

29
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,680
"You little rascal."

30
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,280
It feels like we're wandering

31
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,600
at the world's end now.

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Could it be

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,720
that only this train

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,280
will escape doomsday?

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,200
It seems like I can't hide this

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,400
from you after all.

37
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,720
To be honest, this train is heading

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
to Hogwarts.

39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,160
Hogwarts?

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
What's that?

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Seriously? You Muggle!

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,840
Muggle?

43
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,840
What's a Muggle? Is it tasty?

44
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,680
What time is it?

45
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Why is your shoulder next to my head?

46
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,600
Excuse me?

47
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,840
Clearly, you rested your head

48
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,080
on my shoulder.

49
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,840
I don't even get a thank you.

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,840
Thank you.

51
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,040
It's already 11:55 p.m.

52
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,840
There are five minutes left.

53
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,840
Why do I feel more anxious

54
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,160
as we get closer to midnight?

55
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,680
If...

56
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,000
I mean, hypothetically speaking,

57
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,320
if it's really doomsday in five minutes,

58
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
what should we do?

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,480
Then

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,080
let's leave something behind at least.

61
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
In the final five minutes,

62
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,400
each of us will get one minute

63
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
to say something.

64
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,160
I'll go first.

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,040
It's the final minute.

66
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,720
Let me summarize my life as Guan Fang.

67
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,960
I used to be clueless

68
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,800
<i>and had a distorted understanding</i>

69
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
<i>of this world.</i>

70
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,320
<i>Then I met a group of people,</i>

71
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,000
<i>including everyone here,</i>

72
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,000
<i>who truly changed me</i>

73
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,600
<i>and reshaped me.</i>

74
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,000
<i>I really like the person I've become now.</i>

75
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
<i>Sit properly!</i>

76
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,840
<i>It's the final minute.</i>

77
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,520
<i>Actually, I have no regrets.</i>

78
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,240
<i>Well, there is one.</i>

79
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,680
<i>I couldn't fly to the US</i>

80
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,880
<i>to watch a basketball game.</i>

81
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,960
<i>It's a shame that I couldn't see Kobe.</i>

82
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
<i>Stop exaggerating and scaring yourselves.</i>

83
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,640
<i>I'm an optimistic person.</i>

84
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,040
<i>I have really good luck.</i>

85
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,160
<i>Whenever I buy a soda,</i>

86
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,400
<i>I always get an extra bottle.</i>

87
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,560
<i>When I play claw machines,</i>

88
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,680
<i>I always get the one I want the most.</i>

89
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,320
So as long as I'm here,

90
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,560
this train will reach its destination.

91
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,200
I'll let you have my final minute.

92
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,440
I don't need it.

93
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,600
Then I...

94
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,920
<i>I hope this world</i>

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,800
<i>can split up with doomsday.</i>

96
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,960
<i>Then there won't be doomsday anymore.</i>

97
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,680
<i>Then we'll still have thousands
and millions of minutes</i>

98
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,800
<i>to build a future
with the most important people</i>

99
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,480
<i>in our lives.</i>

100
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,400
Everyone, there are 13 seconds left.

101
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
Ten seconds.

102
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Ten.

103
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,880
Nine.

104
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,200
Eight.

105
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,320
Seven.

106
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,800
-Six.
-Six.

107
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,720
-Five.
-Five.

108
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,960
-Four.
-Four.

109
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,960
-Three. Two.
-Three. Two.

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,080
-One.
-One.

111
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,560
-Nothing happened.
-We're safe.

112
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,480
We're okay!

113
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,480
Yes!

114
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
It's okay now.

115
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,160
We survived doomsday together.

116
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,400
I'll tell you guys a secret.

117
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,080
I just saved the world.

118
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,200
But you have no idea.

119
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,159
You've been watching

120
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,880
too many science fiction movies.

121
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,159
Now it's a new day, right?

122
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,600
It's another day of school.

123
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,680
That's even scarier than doomsday!

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,000
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL
AFFILIATED TO JIANGYI UNIVERSITY

125
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,440
Question number five

126
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,360
should be in the past tense

127
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,160
based on the context,

128
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,480
so the answer is C.

129
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,520
All right.

130
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,000
That's all for today's class.

131
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,000
Class is dismissed.

132
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,400
No homework?

133
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,680
Did she forget?

134
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,560
Miss, you haven't assigned
English homework yet.

135
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,680
Why did she have to bring it up?

136
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,280
The academic competition just ended.

137
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
I won't assign homework for this weekend.

138
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,360
You need to take breaks from studying too,

139
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,800
so get some rest.

140
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,800
Next week, we'll hit the ground running

141
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,160
and prepare for the final exams.

142
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,400
Do you want to play basketball?

143
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
Guan Fang,

144
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,440
I'm busy tonight.

145
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,120
Can we switch our duties today?

146
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,760
I'll cover your shift on Monday.

147
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,600
Okay, no problem.

148
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,840
Thank you, man. I'll get going.

149
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,000
Bye.

150
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,120
I guess I can't play ball.

151
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,120
Do you believe it

152
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,880
when I say Wang Hao will leave
faster than anyone else next Monday?

153
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,720
Guan Fang is just too easygoing.

154
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,040
He always thinks
it's better to avoid trouble.

155
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,320
If it were me...

156
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,280
What would you do?

157
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,520
I would verbally agree
and pretend nothing happened.

158
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,360
In any case, Ms. Zhang would hold
the one on duty accountable,

159
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,720
not me.

160
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,200
We have to teach
such an opportunist a lesson.

161
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,240
You and your evil ideas.

162
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,640
Guan Fang is easygoing.

163
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
It's not something bad.

164
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,640
Being easygoing is fine,

165
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,080
but being too easy is not good for him.

166
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,800
I made some observations.

167
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,400
Liu Quan threw his basketball
into the drain yesterday.

168
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,320
It was a newly-bought ball.

169
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,000
He treasured the ball very much.

170
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,160
But he didn't get angry.

171
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,680
Also, his deskmate, Li Ming,
always spins his pen.

172
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,120
Every now and then,
the ink stains his clothes.

173
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,320
He doesn't react at all.

174
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,480
Really?

175
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,120
From the day I knew him,

176
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,640
I've never seen him
initiate a conflict with anyone.

177
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,440
It doesn't seem good for him.

178
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,680
It makes him an easy target for bullying.

179
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,000
Tomorrow, we're going
to his place to eat, right?

180
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,600
We can give him a word of advice then.

181
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,320
I told Xiaofang to invite you over,

182
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,640
but you guys never came.

183
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,680
I thought it was
because my cooking was bad.

184
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,960
How could that be, Mrs. Guan?

185
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
Your cooking is far better than my mom's.

186
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,000
Just tell me what you want to eat.

187
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Thank you, Mrs. Guan.

188
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,760
GUAN'S DESSERT SHOP

189
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,720
Excuse me!

190
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,840
Your food is spoiled.

191
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,240
How can you sell it?

192
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,720
Spoiled? That's impossible.

193
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,920
Are you saying we're falsely accusing you?

194
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Grandma,

195
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,760
you can carry on.

196
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,520
Get back to work.

197
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,520
GUAN'S DESSERT SHOP

198
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
Please calm down.

199
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,160
Our ingredients

200
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,480
are delivered on the same day.

201
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,760
This has never happened before.

202
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,040
We also ordered the mango pomelo sago.

203
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,160
There's no problem at all.

204
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,760
If I say this is spoiled,

205
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,040
it's spoiled.

206
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,680
How about this?

207
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,400
Your check is waived.

208
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,080
How about that?

209
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,120
We ate something at your place today.

210
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,280
If it gives us food poisoning,

211
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,840
we'll have to go to the hospital.

212
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,160
What are you going to do

213
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,320
about the medical expenses?

214
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,160
You're clearly trying to extort money.

215
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,320
Watch what you're saying!

216
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,320
You shouldn't go too far.

217
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
Well, sirs.

218
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,240
Buy something to eat and drink

219
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,280
to nourish your health.

220
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
You're a sensible kid.

221
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,480
I'll see you two off.

222
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,800
You guys can carry on eating.

223
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,720
Give me back the money.

224
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,960
What?

225
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,840
Give the money back.

226
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,280
There's no reason for us

227
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,000
to give the money back to you.

228
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,520
Is there something wrong with you?

229
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,840
You need a beating.

230
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
What?

231
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,000
What are you trying to do?

232
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,480
Give it back.

233
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,520
Why is he not back yet?

234
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,680
Could Guan Fang be getting bullied?

235
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,040
It's possible.

236
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,080
Those two people look like bullies.

237
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,440
I'll go and check.

238
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,120
Sir,

239
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,840
it's our first time doing this.

240
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,640
We were out of our minds.

241
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,760
We won't do it next time.

242
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,880
We'll avoid your shop next time.

243
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,160
Next time?

244
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,680
No, there won't be a next time.

245
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,680
We promise.

246
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,480
Yes.

247
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,840
Hey! What are you doing?

248
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,160
How much money could a student have?

249
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,600
That's enough.

250
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,880
Sorry, sir.

251
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,840
We were wrong.

252
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,080
-Let's talk it out.
-We were wrong.

253
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,280
Just don't hit us.

254
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,120
Don't just stand there. Apologize to him.

255
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,840
-I'm sorry. We won't do it next time.
-I'm sorry.

256
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,560
That's more like it.

257
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,560
Listen.

258
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,720
Don't let me see you guys around the shop.

259
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,960
-Do you hear me?
-Don't worry.

260
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,000
Get lost!

261
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,800
Gu Ran is so imposing.

262
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,880
I didn't expect you to be so capable.

263
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,880
Are you okay?

264
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,320
It's nothing.

265
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,360
These guys are so weird.

266
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,560
They suddenly acted
like they were being bullied.

267
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,760
Look,

268
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,760
you shouldn't be scared
of people like them.

269
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,960
Just look at me.

270
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,560
Did you see how scared they were?

271
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
But they're too timid.

272
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,520
I didn't even hit them.

273
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
They're cowards
who have never seen the world.

274
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,760
Thank you.

275
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,720
Grandma, I'm back.

276
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,920
Xiaofang, come here.

277
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,120
Why are you so serious?

278
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,840
{\an8}Did you get into a fight again today?

279
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,880
Grandma, what are you thinking?

280
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,520
I'm not someone who loves to fight.

281
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,720
I'm glad to hear that.

282
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm genuinely worried.

283
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,080
{\an8}You used to come home

284
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
{\an8}with injuries all over your face.

285
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,280
You would get new injuries

286
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,520
on top of the old injuries.

287
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,800
That was such a long time ago.

288
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,080
I was young and ignorant at the time.

289
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,040
Grandma, please stop bringing up my past.

290
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,880
Jiang Jia and Su Zaizai teased me

291
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,040
for over a week about my bed-wetting.

292
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,440
Don't bring it up anymore.

293
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm glad you didn't fight.

294
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,040
But your friends now are pretty nice.

295
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,960
I like them.

296
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,480
You should be more like them.

297
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,640
I don't want you
to be who you were before.

298
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,120
Grandma, don't worry.

299
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,520
I won't.

300
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,600
You must be hungry.

301
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,920
I made stewed ribs for you.

302
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,200
It's your favorite.

303
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Come and get some.

304
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,000
TEACHING BUILDING B

305
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,800
Wang Hao.

306
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,480
Didn't you switch duties with Guan Fang?

307
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,600
Aren't you going to clean?

308
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
Guan Fang, unfortunately,

309
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,280
my relatives are visiting today.

310
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,960
How about you do the duty today?

311
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,280
I'll return the favor next time.

312
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,160
What do you think?

313
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
I can go home later.

314
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,080
Well,

315
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,760
I'll stay for duty

316
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,080
and go home after that.

317
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,360
You can go now.

318
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,440
<i>I don't have much homework today.</i>

319
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,400
I'll come and help out before going home.

320
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,400
Okay, Grandma, don't worry.

321
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,240
I'll be right there. I'm hanging up now.

322
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,240
Buddy,

323
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,520
he was the one who took our money.

324
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,880
Were you the one

325
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,800
who picked on my friends?

326
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
It was him.

327
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
Did you ask me before you did that?

328
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,680
Okay.

329
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,600
Wait!

330
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
I dare you to leave.

331
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,040
If you leave, we'll go to your grandma.

332
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,360
It's called Guan's Dessert Shop, right?

333
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,200
That old woman

334
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,200
is pretty old.

335
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,400
It wouldn't be unusual
if she stumbles or bumps into things.

336
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,560
Yes.

337
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,400
-What are you doing?
-Do you dare?

338
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,600
What do you want?

339
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,240
I'm not exaggerating.

340
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,520
Guan Fang has clearly changed.

341
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,920
It's not just about the duty.

342
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,040
Someone tried to take over
our basketball court today

343
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,000
and he didn't let them.

344
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,560
He won a game and took it back.

345
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,160
If it were before,

346
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,360
he would have let it go.

347
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,600
This shows

348
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,040
that what we taught Guan Fang
is effective.

349
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,080
That's right.

350
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,640
We've essentially saved his future.

351
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,200
That's noble.

352
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,640
Get him!

353
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,280
Do you want to escape?

354
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,600
Beat him!

355
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,600
I...

356
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,240
This is not just a change.

357
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,680
He has practically transformed.

358
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,000
Help him out!

359
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,160
I apologize for what I said before.

360
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,360
Gu Ran didn't teach you.

361
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,640
Instead, you should teach him.

362
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,600
GUAN'S DESSERT SHOP

363
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,280
If I had known

364
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,560
he was so good at this,

365
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,440
I wouldn't have joined in the fight.

366
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,640
Luckily, we found out in time

367
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,760
or else it would be embarrassing for us

368
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,880
to teach you more nonsense.

369
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,880
At first,

370
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,240
I didn't want you guys to find out.

371
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,640
It's nothing to be proud of.

372
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,280
You could say it was what you would call

373
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,880
a rebellious stage.

374
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,840
It was in the eighth grade.

375
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,800
At that time, I just felt

376
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,440
learning those dry subjects was useless.

377
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,800
I just wanted to make a name
for myself with my fists.

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,920
{\an8}I mistook immaturity for brotherhood.

379
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,280
My temper would explode

380
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,560
at the slightest provocation.

381
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,760
Listen closely.

382
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,200
If I ever see you
messing with my friend again,

383
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,680
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

384
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
<i>I'm not exaggerating.</i>

385
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,360
<i>At that time, almost no one at school</i>

386
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,280
<i>wanted to have anything to do with me.</i>

387
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,400
<i>Even the teachers
thought I was a troublemaker.</i>

388
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,280
<i>The most common phrase
I heard back then was,</i>

389
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,960
<i>"One bad apple</i>

390
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,080
<i>spoils the whole barrel."</i>

391
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,520
<i>Look at you.</i>

392
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,800
You can't even stand or sit properly.

393
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,560
Stand here properly as punishment.

394
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,560
<i>To prevent myself
from spoiling their precious barrel,</i>

395
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
<i>I started skipping school even more.</i>

396
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,040
<i>Maybe it wasn't just rebellion.</i>

397
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,480
I was already a bad person.

398
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,080
So was what those hooligans did

399
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,480
something that you used to do?

400
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,800
You're quite legendary.

401
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,880
But looking back now,

402
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,760
I was so full of myself back then.

403
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,880
I thought I was tough and cool.

404
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,640
When I skipped PE class,

405
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,600
my parents gave me a beating.

406
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,880
Didn't your grandma punish you?

407
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,320
Right. Why did you eventually change?

408
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,320
Later, I suddenly realized...

409
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,680
Just leave.

410
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,600
Sorry.

411
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,000
<i>The so-called invincibility
that I thought I had</i>

412
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
<i>was because someone</i>

413
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,960
<i>was silently facing
the consequences for me.</i>

414
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,520
<i>I caused trouble.</i>

415
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,640
<i>She apologized.</i>

416
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,520
<i>I don't know when it started</i>

417
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,560
<i>to become a given.</i>

418
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,400
Mrs. Guan, I'll be honest with you.

419
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,720
No school would dare

420
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,480
to accept a student like Guan Fang.

421
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,720
We've given him so many chances.

422
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,080
But he keeps repeating his mistakes.

423
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,400
{\an8}We truly have no other choice,

424
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,720
{\an8}but to advise him to drop out.

425
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,440
Miss, you're right.

426
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,040
But Xiaofang

427
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,720
was a really good kid when he was young.

428
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,840
I'll try and talk to him again.

429
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,480
He used to listen to me the most.

430
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
-We're in a difficult position here.
-I beg of you.

431
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,040
Please.

432
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,960
-<i>My grandma used to be quite fierce</i>
-He used to listen

433
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,160
-<i>when she was younger.</i>
-to me the most.

434
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,240
<i>She had a reputation in the neighborhood.</i>

435
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,280
<i>I've never seen her pleading</i>

436
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,800
<i>with someone in such a humble way.</i>

437
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,960
Xiaofang, let's go home.

438
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,760
Let's go home.

439
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,800
STUDENT AFFAIRS OFFICE

440
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,600
<i>That was when I realized</i>

441
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,760
<i>that she seemed to have aged a bit.</i>

442
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,480
Xiaofang,

443
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,160
sometimes, I envy you.

444
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,400
You can still study at your age.

445
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,600
You still have opportunities

446
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,760
to do what you like to do.

447
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,040
{\an8}Actually, fists can't save the world.

448
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
{\an8}You still need to use the pen.

449
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,440
Stop fighting

450
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,960
{\an8}and focus on studying, okay?

451
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,920
<i>I can't even imagine</i>

452
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,320
how she managed

453
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,320
to bear so much criticism

454
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,160
and calmly discuss the future with me

455
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,160
when she has such a frail body.

456
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,160
That's the end of the story.

457
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,400
After that, I turned over a new leaf
and became a different person.

458
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,640
Well? I used to be quite lost, right?

459
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,960
No, a reformed bad boy is the coolest.

460
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,040
It's super cool.

461
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,120
GUAN'S DESSERT SHOP

462
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,440
GUAN'S DESSERT SHOP

463
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,000
Bye, Mrs. Guan.

464
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
-Bye, Mrs. Guan.
-Bye, Mrs. Guan.

465
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,360
Goodbye.

466
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,840
GUAN'S DESSERT SHOP

467
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,840
Come on. Let's go home.

468
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,000
Let's head home.

469
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,400
It feels cold all of a sudden.

470
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,520
Let's go.

471
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,240
GUAN'S DESSERT SHOP

472
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,400
Watch your step.

473
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm okay.

474
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,080
{\an8}How fast time flies.

475
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,880
{\an8}It's another year already.

476
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,200
I only learned today

477
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,800
that you wanted to be a boxing champion

478
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,800
when you were young.

479
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,920
As you said, that was when I was young.

480
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,160
I'm a lot older now.

481
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,400
Do you blame me

482
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,720
for being too strict with you back then?

483
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,720
How could I?

484
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,480
As you said, that was when I was young.

485
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,840
I'm a lot older now.

486
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,920
Yes, you'll be another year older soon.

487
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,120
Do you still have any dreams now?

488
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,240
Yes.

489
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,400
I hope...

490
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,600
I hope you can continue to accompany me

491
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,240
for a very long time.

492
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,560
"With lowered head
and skillful fingers playing endlessly,

493
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,920
talking about countless things.

494
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,920
Slowly...

495
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,120
Slowly plucking and strumming.

496
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,760
Plucking and strumming..."

497
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,120
"The emperor will no longer
attend the morning court."

498
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,800
"The emperor..."

499
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
What? Don't mess around.

500
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,960
You have an exam in ten minutes.

501
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Can you memorize it all?

502
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,480
I'll memorize as much as I can.

503
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,000
This cold air is like a natural energizer.

504
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,920
I'll no longer believe
those study methods online.

505
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,240
What methods?

506
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,240
They say that knowledge
will enter your brain

507
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,000
if you sleep with books as your pillow.

508
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,040
I slept on the books all night.

509
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,040
Then what happened?

510
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,040
I woke up with a stiff neck.

511
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,720
Let's go.

512
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,000
It's about time.

513
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,840
Let's go.

514
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,720
Good luck.

515
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,560
-Bye.
-Rangrang.

516
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,920
Good luck.

517
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,720
You too.

518
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,160
Stop studying. Let's go.

519
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,800
Rangrang,

520
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,640
when are you going back to Suyang?

521
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,320
Tomorrow.

522
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,080
That's so soon.

523
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,240
Take these.

524
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,440
What about you?

525
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,120
I'm not cold.

526
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,640
Your gloves are surely different.

527
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,600
I don't feel cold at all.

528
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,120
You're exaggerating.

529
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,800
What's wrong?

530
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,560
We'll be apart for a month

531
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,440
once you go back to Suyang.

532
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,880
Every glance counts now.

533
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,120
I have to make good use of my time
and look at you more.

534
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,880
It's only a month.

535
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,400
Relationships between people

536
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,760
need maintenance.

537
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,640
Even just a week without contact

538
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,800
can cause the feelings to fade.

539
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,760
I don't want the first thing I say to you

540
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,560
when you come back to be,

541
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
"It has been a long time.

542
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,200
Do you still remember me?"

543
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
So I'll text you.

544
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,600
I'll take the initiative to keep in touch

545
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,840
since I'm used to it anyway.

546
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,160
Well, I'll go now.

547
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,560
I'll reply to you.

548
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,040
I will reply to your text messages.

549
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,960
It's a deal then.

550
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,400
It's snowing.

551
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
It's the first snowfall.

552
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,560
<i>I noticed that when the world
created grandmas,</i>

553
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,560
<i>it seemed to follow a fixed formula.</i>

554
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,520
<i>Thank you, Grandma.</i>

555
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,040
<i>Grandmas' sliced apples</i>

556
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,880
<i>always have
the subtle flavor of green onions.</i>

557
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,040
{\an8}<i>Grandmas always hunch over,</i>

558
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,600
{\an8}<i>yet their steps are steady.</i>

559
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,600
<i>Grandmas' bright white aprons</i>

560
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,360
<i>are tidy and clean.</i>

561
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,600
<i>Come and have some.</i>

562
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
<i>Have some fruit.</i>

563
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,800
<i>Grandmas always think</i>

564
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,960
<i>we never have enough to eat.</i>

565
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,520
<i>Here you go.</i>

566
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,840
<i>We still have grapes.</i>

567
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
<i>Here.</i>

568
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,120
<i>Enjoy yourselves.</i>

569
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,000
<i>Grandmas' living spaces are small,</i>

570
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,560
<i>too small to fit large furniture.</i>

571
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,760
<i>Yet they are also spacious.</i>

572
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,800
<i>They are spacious enough</i>

573
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,560
<i>to encompass our entire childhood.</i>

574
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,120
<i>I kind of miss my grandma,</i>

575
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,480
<i>but I dare not tell Dad</i>

576
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,920
<i>because I know</i>

577
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,440
<i>he misses his mom too.</i>

578
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,440
I KIND OF MISS MY GRANDMA,

579
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,360
BUT I DARE NOT TELL DAD

580
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,520
BECAUSE I KNOW HE MISSES HIS MOM TOO
