{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,

{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,000
<i>A Mutual Idol.</i>

6
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,680
Is Zhang Lurang going to transfer?

7
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,800
Why so suddenly?

8
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,160
I heard this from my mom.

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,480
Perhaps it's due to his enrollment status.

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
I don't think Lurang wants to leave.

11
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
He hasn't been like himself recently.

12
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,160
He hasn't told us about it either.

13
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,160
Does Su Zaizai know about it?

14
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,200
She must.

15
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,720
She seemed upset recently.

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,720
I thought she had a fight with someone.

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,160
I'm sure
it's because of Zhang Lurang's transfer.

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,160
You are right.

19
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,480
I'm sure Zhang Lurang told her first.

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,360
Zaizai must be sad right now.

21
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,280
I need to figure out how to comfort her.

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,600
Comfort her?

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,040
Won't she add fuel to the fire instead?

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,880
That's hard to say.

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,000
Have you been upset recently

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,360
because of Zhang Lurang?

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,280
Have you noticed?

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
It's too obvious.

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,400
You two haven't
gone home together in days.

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,200
But I can relate.

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,760
I've experienced it before after all.

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,440
Was it because of Qianyu?

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,160
It is hard to accept at first,

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,840
but you need to go with the flow.

35
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,200
Just accept the truth.

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,000
But I just can't accept it.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,120
I don't think it's that bad.

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,720
Even if he is transferring schools,

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,440
you can still call him.

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,880
Suyang isn't far.

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,040
You can go see him during the holidays.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
Transfer schools?

43
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,920
Aren't you upset

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,960
because of Zhang Lurang's transfer?

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,040
Is he going to transfer?

46
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,400
Didn't you know about it?

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,160
When is he leaving?

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,960
I don't know.

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,360
Do you want me to ask Gu Ran?

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
All of you knew.

51
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,000
Only I didn't know.

52
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,600
Zaizai.

53
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,640
Go home first.

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,840
I'm going to ask him.

55
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,000
What's the matter?

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,520
Are you going to transfer schools?

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,279
Actually,

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,720
I wanted to turn around and run

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,399
a few times on my way here.

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
I was afraid of hearing your answer.

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,520
But if I don't ask you now,

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,240
I'm not sure
if I'll still have the courage

63
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,480
to ask you again tomorrow.

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,080
I thought...

65
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,280
I thought you only found me annoying

66
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,760
and that we are at least still friends.

67
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,920
I would just stop pestering you.

68
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,440
But everyone knew about your transfer

69
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,000
except me.

70
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
What you did

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,240
makes me think I'm not important at all.

72
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,600
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,640
It's getting late. I'm leaving.

74
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,240
Su Zaizai.

75
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,440
I SAW A BOY OUTSIDE THE STORE.
HE LOOKS SO HANDSOME!

76
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Zaizai, are you not sitting here?

77
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,880
I don't want to be a nuisance.

78
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,480
Where is Su Zaizai?

79
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,760
Zaizai is on duty. She went to get water.

80
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,040
By herself?

81
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,880
She has me.

82
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,280
Gu Ran, are you willing to stay back

83
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
and complete this honorable mission
with us?

84
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,280
No.

85
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,480
Lurang, what about you?

86
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,160
Sure.

87
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,680
I knew you would say yes.

88
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,960
Lurang.

89
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,480
I'm touched.

90
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
I'll go and get water.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,280
DRAMA CLUB

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,000
I can do it myself.

93
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,120
Su Zaizai.

94
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,560
Don't you think

95
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,880
Su Zaizai has been acting weird recently?

96
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,760
When she told us she was leaving first,

97
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,000
she said bye to all of us

98
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,280
except you.

99
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,960
What did you do

100
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,280
to make her hate you so much?

101
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,480
Zaizai?

102
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,520
Who is that person?

103
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,640
I don't know.

104
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,520
You two are so close.

105
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,040
What a useless friend you are.

106
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,560
Zhang Lurang is clearly closer to her.

107
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,040
ALL VISITORS MUST REGISTER TO ENTER

108
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,320
That's not necessarily true now.

109
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,640
The guy is quite handsome.

110
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,080
How ignorant can you be?

111
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,920
How is he handsome?

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,880
It's not the weekend,

113
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,440
but he's not wearing a school uniform.

114
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,040
He's obviously a shady guy.

115
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,400
I heard girls in our class say

116
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,600
that boys from other schools

117
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,640
have been waiting outside
to seek out girls.

118
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
They even whistle like hooligans.

119
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,440
Is he one of them?

120
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,280
This isn't good. I must ask her tonight.

121
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,240
<i>I heard girls in our class say</i>

122
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,520
<i>that boys from other schools</i>

123
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,560
<i>have been waiting outside

124
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,000
<i>They even whistle like hooligans.</i>

125
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,800
<i>Is he one of them?</i>

126
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,800
Lurang.

127
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,720
Lurang!

128
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,480
Uncle, I'm going to the store.

129
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,000
Bring your wallet.

130
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,720
My wallet.

131
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,440
Why is he so absent-minded?

132
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,880
This is not bad. Why aren't you eating?

133
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,600
Eat more if you like it.

134
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,000
Right.

135
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,280
When you transferred,
did you tell your friends

136
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
from your previous school?

137
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,040
Of course. We are friends after all.

138
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,080
Was there anyone you didn't tell?

139
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,120
There was one.

140
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,480
A girl from the neighboring class

141
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,880
used to bother me all the time,

142
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,240
so I didn't tell her about the transfer.

143
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
If I had told her,

144
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,040
she would've asked me so many questions.

145
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,560
It would be annoying if she showed up

146
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,680
during the holidays.

147
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,360
Sometimes,

148
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,960
when someone is too enthusiastic,

149
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
it is actually a burden for others.

150
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,560
{\an8}You should eat air instead.

151
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,360
{\an8}What are you doing?

152
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,800
{\an8}Is this how you treat your brother?

153
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,560
Mind your words.

154
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,040
You are my cousin.

155
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,520
It belongs to the one who paid.

156
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,840
-No, it's mine.
-Give it to me.

157
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Let go.

158
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,480
I don't care. It's mine.

159
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,040
-It's mine.
-You cannot eat anymore.

160
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,760
-Stop eating.
-I'm going to eat.

161
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,600
<i>There are also these.</i>

162
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,080
This one is also good. Try it.

163
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,960
Did you eat it?

164
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,920
I'll choke you.

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,400
Su Zaizai.

166
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,120
What are you doing?

167
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,440
{\an8}What am I doing? Buddy.

168
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,560
She's the one beating me up.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,160
I'll walk you home.

170
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,440
No.

171
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,400
Su Zaizai.

172
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,560
You can say that I'm annoying.

173
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,680
I don't mean to be around you anyway.

174
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,880
Let's go.

175
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
Say something.

176
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,600
Who was that person?

177
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,480
Just an ordinary classmate.

178
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,000
An ordinary classmate?

179
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,840
Did you forget the look on his face

180
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,880
when he thought I was bullying you?

181
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,640
There is no way he's just a classmate.

182
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,960
He has a sense of justice.

183
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,200
Aren't all guys like that?

184
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,200
You don't know guys at all.

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,480
<i>At the convenience store just now,</i>

186
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,520
<i>why did you...</i>

187
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,160
Forget it. I'm not thinking about it.

188
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,640
SU ZAIZAI

189
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,920
ARE YOU NOT AT THE BUS STOP YET?
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,280
I NEED TO SEE YOU,
I'M OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE

191
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,960
Where is Su Zaizai?

192
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,400
Zaizai's cousin is here.

193
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,160
She is showing him around the school
during the lunch break.

194
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,800
I can buy a bottle of milk for her.

195
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Cousin?

196
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,640
Why did her cousin come to our school?

197
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,840
I think he's transferring here
next semester.

198
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,040
He is the guy we saw yesterday

199
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,360
at the school entrance.

200
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,120
I thought he was someone else.

201
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,800
What are you laughing at?

202
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,920
It's nothing.

203
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,680
What do you want to eat?

204
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,760
JIANGYI UNIVERSITY

205
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,720
JIANGYI UNIVERSITY

206
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,320
Su Zaizai.

207
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
What for?

209
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
I made you angry.

210
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,840
I just think

211
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,240
that if you really do find me annoying,
I can...

212
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,200
I've never found you annoying.

213
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,600
Then why did you tell everyone

214
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,880
about your school transfer

215
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,600
except me?

216
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,160
I never told them about it.

217
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,440
I wanted...

218
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,200
I wanted to tell you first.

219
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,960
But I thought about it for a long time

220
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,120
and didn't know how to tell you.

221
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,600
Why?

222
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,600
Because you are

223
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,320
a special friend to me.

224
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,760
When are you going back to Suyang?

225
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Next semester.

226
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,760
There are a few months left.

227
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,560
Are you

228
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,400
still angry?

229
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,000
Yes.

230
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm a little angry.

231
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,880
Actually, it's not just a little.

232
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,840
I've been so angry

233
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,960
that I couldn't eat lunch for a few days.

234
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,920
Make your choice.

235
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,680
Pick between comforting me or losing me.

236
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,920
If you don't pick,

237
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,120
I'll really get angry.

238
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
How do I comfort you?

239
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,680
Just act cute.

240
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,440
It's easy.

241
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,760
Let me teach you.

242
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,680
I'm Zaizai.

243
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,880
Try it.

244
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,720
I'm...

245
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,440
Rangrang.

246
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,480
Are you mad?

247
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,800
No.

248
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Give me a smile.

249
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,280
I can't.

250
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,240
Give me a smile.

251
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,200
I don't feel like it.

252
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,600
Then you are angry.

253
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,600
Why would I be angry?

254
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,760
I don't want to be angry.

255
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,760
<i>Smile.</i>

256
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
<i>I don't want to.</i>

257
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,080
GRADE 11, CLASS 1

258
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
There will be
a prefectural academic competition

259
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,640
held in our school next Tuesday.

260
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,480
It will be on this floor,

261
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,440
so in the next few days,

262
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,560
you need to take all of your things home.

263
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,319
Clean off all the doodles and stickers

264
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,640
on your tables.

265
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,200
Empty the classroom by Tuesday.

266
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,240
Got it?

267
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,280
-Yes.
-Yes.

268
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
So now,

269
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,400
we're making space

270
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,960
for those good kids to fight.

271
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,280
But you look happy today.

272
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,960
Do you not plan to tell us
about your transfer?

273
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,960
Don't all of you already know about it?

274
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll be the only one left in this class

275
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,280
starting next semester.

276
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,240
I'm bored just thinking about it.

277
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes, Luli wanted to come here on his own,

278
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,840
but his exam is important,

279
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,240
so his dad and I came together

280
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,360
because we were worried.

281
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
It's not my first time traveling alone.

282
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,840
You have the cheek to be saying that.

283
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,320
Who almost got lost

284
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,680
at the bus station last time?

285
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,600
Exactly.

286
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,120
You are only good at studying.

287
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,640
Lurang.

288
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,720
You're back, Lurang.

289
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,640
Dad. Mom.

290
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,640
Lurang.

291
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Luli has an exam next week at our school.

292
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,480
For the next few days,

293
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,520
he and other students

294
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,960
will come to our school

295
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,280
to sit in on Grade 12 lessons.

296
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,320
He will be staying here.

297
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,000
Sure.

298
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,120
Will there be a problem

299
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,320
if you two share a room?

300
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,880
Why would there be a problem?

301
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Luli loved sleeping with Lurang
when he was young.

302
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,480
Right?

303
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,640
You are right.

304
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,960
I'll get a bigger blanket
for you two later.

305
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,400
Lurang, take this opportunity

306
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,200
to ask Luli if you have any questions.

307
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,680
When he was in Grade 11,

308
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
he was already studying a semester ahead.

309
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Lurang,

310
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
do you have a lot of homework today?

311
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,360
It's manageable.

312
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,000
Lurang,

313
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,760
are you not happy

314
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,480
that I'm here?

315
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,920
Don't imagine things.

316
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,560
Class dismissed.

317
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
-Goodbye, sir!
-Goodbye, sir!

318
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,840
Jiang Jia, aren't you going?

319
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,760
I'm not.

320
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,240
You fooled me into going last period

321
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,880
and there was no one there.

322
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,040
I would rather take a nap.

323
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,320
-We'll go without you. Let's go.
-See you.

324
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,080
What are you talking about?

325
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,360
Who are you going to see?

326
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,640
We have students from other schools coming

327
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,840
to sit in on lessons today.

328
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,600
I heard there is a genius

329
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,360
who is in Grade 12 at the age of 16.

330
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,520
He skipped two grades.

331
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,080
Most importantly, he is quite handsome.

332
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,360
That's rarer than an endangered species.

333
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,400
All of them are going to see him.

334
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,200
There is no need to go.

335
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,600
There are posts of him on the forum.

336
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,000
Here it is. High-definition photos.

337
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,200
Let me see.

338
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,840
Why does he look familiar?

339
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,480
He looks

340
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
like Zhang Lurang.

341
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,320
A little.

342
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,480
The class ended a few minutes ago.

343
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,000
What is taking them so long?

344
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
The mart will have no more food left.

345
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,560
Ms. Zhang was teaching this period.

346
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,480
No wonder.

347
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,520
Zaizai, look. It's that genius.

348
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,360
Why is he here?

349
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,600
Who is he waiting for?

350
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,760
Hurry up. I'm starving.

351
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
{\an8}Lurang.

352
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,680
Lurang?

353
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,200
Luli.

354
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,920
Lurang,

355
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,560
Mom is waiting for us at the entrance,

356
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,880
so I came to find you.

357
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,560
She is here for you.

358
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,240
I still have evening self-study.

359
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,360
Leave without me.

360
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,760
I didn't know you came.

361
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,280
Let's play basketball tomorrow.

362
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,880
Gu Ran.

363
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,960
I have to go.

364
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,760
Let's go.

365
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,000
Rangrang, are you also an only child?

366
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,640
I have a younger brother.

367
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Younger brother?

368
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,720
Do you two look alike?

369
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,040
Probably, yes.

370
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,440
Do you have similar personalities?

371
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
No.

372
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,240
He is nice.

373
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,560
You are nice too.

374
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
I mean, you're nicer.

375
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,560
Which one of you is better looking?

376
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,000
My brother.

377
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,640
No.

378
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,600
You are the most handsome.

379
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,040
You're probably

380
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,720
<i>the only one that says so.</i>

381
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,960
Zhang Lurang.

382
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,000
I heard the genius in Grade 12's auditors

383
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,040
is your little brother.

384
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,360
Is that true?

385
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,200
If you had the same curiosity in studying,

386
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,080
Ms. Zhang would wake up every morning

387
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,080
in laughter.

388
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,280
My grades are average.

389
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,440
I really envy Zhang Lurang.

390
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,160
He doesn't have
to tutor his little brother.

391
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,880
He can be the one being tutored instead.

392
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,960
These people have too much free time.

393
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,640
Gossip spreads like wildfire.

394
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,880
Their names are so similar.

395
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,560
It turns out they really are siblings.

396
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,280
How do you get the news so quickly?

397
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,480
It's all over the forum.

398
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,080
Everyone already knows about it.

399
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,080
I'm really envious of his family's genes.

400
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,360
How can both their children
be so excellent?

401
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,640
Why is the little brother
already in Grade 12

402
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,120
and has gotten so many awards,

403
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,760
while Zhang Lurang is only in Grade 11?

404
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,160
His little brother outshines him.

405
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,200
What do you mean by "only"?

406
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,680
All of us are only in Grade 11 too.

407
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,640
Everyone is different.

408
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,360
You can't keep comparing them.

409
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,120
They are brothers.

410
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,880
It's normal to compare them.

411
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,960
I'm just saying.

412
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,320
You're so petty.

413
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,080
Yes, I am petty.

414
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,560
Are you not eating at the canteen either?

415
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,560
It's too crowded.

416
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,440
All the noise hurts my ears.

417
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,960
We're about to head to your place.

418
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,680
You have good taste.

419
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
RESULTS BOARD

420
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,840
GRADE 11 STUDENT RANKINGS

421
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,760
What is it?

422
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,080
{\an8}Rangrang,

423
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,320
{\an8}you scored 110 in English
in the last monthly exam!

424
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,440
Which teacher is so good at teaching you?

425
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,920
Aren't you ashamed of praising yourself?

426
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,480
Why should I

427
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,840
be ashamed?

428
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,280
Guan Fang,

429
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,480
what is that on your lips?

430
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,120
Lip balm.

431
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Jiang Jia gave it to me.

432
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,880
How do you know I used lip balm?

433
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,360
Isn't it transparent?

434
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,480
Sorry, I didn't know this lip balm

435
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,360
could change color.

436
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,280
Jiang Jia.

437
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,160
If you have guts, don't run!

438
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,760
I don't have guts!

439
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,240
Today,

440
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,960
I'm going to kill you.

441
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,680
You...

442
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Lurang,

443
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,280
it's the weekend tomorrow.

444
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,040
Why don't we go to the amusement park?

445
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,640
Isn't Jiangyi Amusement Park said
to be a lot of fun?

446
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
I have homework to do.

447
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,920
What about the day after tomorrow?

448
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,600
Where do you want to go? We can...

449
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,520
We'll see.

450
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,800
Okay.

451
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,960
I won't disturb you anymore.

452
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,240
Lurang.

453
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,760
Are you done with your homework?

454
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,840
Yes.

455
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,280
Do you want to play games?

456
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,560
I made sure to bring it from Suyang.

457
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,480
I'm stuck at this level.

458
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,120
I'm sure you can pass it immediately.

459
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Play on your own.

460
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,600
I'll play for only half an hour.

461
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,560
Lurang, you're cheating!

462
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,640
I'll go easy on you in the next round.

463
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,440
You said so.

464
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,720
Be quiet. The kids are studying.

465
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,520
Lurang.

466
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
How could you make your brother play games

467
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
at a time like this?

468
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,640
It wasn't Lurang...

469
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,240
I don't even know what to say.

470
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,440
Luli never plays games back at home.

471
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,080
You're already a bad influence on him.

472
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,640
Games erode your ambition.

473
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,560
Lurang,

474
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,040
can you put yourself in our shoes?

475
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,760
If you could be
as diligent as your brother...

476
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,200
Mom!

477
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,520
Can you please stop it?

478
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Did I say anything wrong?

479
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,720
What is with that attitude?

480
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,920
Stop it!

481
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,240
I asked Lurang to play with me.

482
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,600
But you didn't even ask.

483
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,760
I'm serious.

484
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,120
Can you stop doing this?

485
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,600
I'm coming.

486
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,080
-Mom, is Luli in your room?
-What is it?

487
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,360
No.

488
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,880
Isn't he in your room?

489
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
No. I called him and he didn't pick up.

490
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,680
Luli.

491
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Luli.

492
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,400
Lin Mao, is Luli in your room?

493
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,920
No.

494
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,880
What's wrong?

495
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,880
Our son is missing.

496
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,840
Luli?

497
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
What's going on?

498
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,760
-Luli?
-What's going on?

499
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,040
Luli?

500
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,480
Why didn't you know when he left

501
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,880
when you two were in the same room?

502
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,840
Enough. It's no use talking about this.

503
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,240
Let's go out and find him.

504
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,640
Luli is not familiar with Jiangyi.

505
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,880
He can't be far.

506
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,400
-Yes, let's go find him.
-Let's go.

507
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,120
Do you want
the Superb-brand mosquito coil?

508
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,960
All right, I know.

509
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,200
I'll head home after I buy it.

510
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,440
Aren't all these brands

511
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,760
pretty much the same?

512
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,440
Have you seen
a 16-year-old student around here?

513
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,560
Rangrang?

514
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,200
Why do you look so worried?

515
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,360
Did something happen?

516
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,480
My brother went missing.

517
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,320
He is

518
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,480
probably quite emotional.

519
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,520
It's a boy

520
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,280
who is wearing a gray short-sleeve shirt.

521
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,440
I don't think I've seen him.

522
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,760
Okay, thank you.

523
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,800
I have to go.

524
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,800
Rangrang.

525
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,720
You're not as familiar
with Jiangyi as I am.

526
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,000
Why don't I help you find him?

527
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,720
-Sure.
-Let's go.

528
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Luli!

529
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,480
<i>Sorry.</i>

530
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,320
-Luli!
-<i>The subscriber you dialed</i>

531
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,720
-He is not picking up his phone.
-<i>isn't picking up.</i>

532
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,760
<i>Please try again later.</i>

533
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,040
Is he still not picking up?

534
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,480
Let's look over there.

535
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,440
{\an8}Zhang Luli!

536
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,560
{\an8}Luli!

537
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,240
CHENYANG NEIGHBORHOOD

538
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,480
-Did you find him?
-No. What about you?

539
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,520
No.

540
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,800
We even went to the school
and didn't see him.

541
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,840
He's not at the bus station either.

542
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,480
We could report it to the police.

543
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,880
The police have more resources.

544
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,080
Yes, let's go to the police.

545
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,440
Let's go right now. Come on.

546
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,440
Lurang,

547
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,440
go home to rest.

548
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,120
We don't need so many people to go.

549
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,440
How can he rest at a time like this?

550
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,920
Zhang Lurang, I don't mean to nag.

551
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,200
You were with your brother,

552
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,160
but you didn't even know when he left.

553
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,960
That's enough.

554
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,320
Would he have done this

555
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,440
if you hadn't scolded him?

556
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,400
-What did I say?
-You...

557
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,800
What did I say?

558
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,040
Why are you talking about this?

559
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,840
{\an8}The most important thing is to find Luli.

560
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,920
I'll look for him in other places.

561
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,040
I'll go to the police.

562
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,680
Search for him. Quick!

563
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,640
Let's go.

564
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,280
You don't know me,

565
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,960
but I know you.

566
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,280
Zhang Luli, right?

567
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,920
My name is Su Zaizai.

568
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,280
I'm your brother's friend.

569
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,560
Are you the one

570
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,280
who gave him that talking toy?

571
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,080
Toy?

572
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,000
That one?

573
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,480
Did he tell you about that?

574
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,680
I saw it myself.

575
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,960
He never tells me about these things.

576
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,440
When I knew I would be coming here,

577
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,560
I was very happy

578
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,720
because this place must be great

579
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,880
if my brother likes it.

580
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,880
I have always idolized him.

581
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,920
I couldn't tie my shoelaces

582
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,280
when I was a kid.

583
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,840
{\an8}<i>Lurang always tied them for me.</i>

584
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,640
<i>I didn't remember the way back home.</i>

585
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,560
Lurang!

586
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,120
<i>He waited for me
outside the school every day.</i>

587
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,800
<i>Sometimes, he bought lollipops for me
with his pocket money.</i>

588
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,880
<i>He is</i>

589
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,360
<i>only a year older than me,</i>

590
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,200
<i>but I already thought</i>

591
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,760
<i>he was amazing.</i>

592
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,280
<i>He is so much more amazing than me.</i>

593
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,240
<i>Perhaps the bias</i>

594
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,800
<i>started with an extra fried egg,</i>

595
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,880
<i>choosing one parent-teacher meeting
over another,</i>

596
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,719
<i>or a pointless comparison.</i>

597
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,400
<i>But once it started,</i>

598
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,440
<i>everything that followed
seemed to be a given.</i>

599
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,520
<i>Even I</i>

600
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,560
<i>became an accomplice.</i>

601
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,760
Luli.

602
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,040
Lurang.

603
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,560
Do you know how to solve this problem?

604
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,480
Yes.

605
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,600
-Then...
-This question is really easy.

606
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,080
Lurang, don't you know how to do it?

607
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,239
<i>I was so happy that time.</i>

608
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,000
<i>My all-mighty brother asked me a question.</i>

609
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,440
<i>I thought I could help him.</i>

610
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,280
<i>However,</i>

611
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,600
<i>I was ignorant back then.</i>

612
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,560
<i>I was</i>

613
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,280
very ignorant.

614
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,560
It was only later that I noticed.

615
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,040
Those people kept saying...

616
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,560
<i>Lurang, your scores
are much lower than Luli's scores.</i>

617
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,680
<i>Did you even study?</i>

618
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,400
<i>Lurang,</i>

619
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,920
<i>I'm tired of lecturing you.</i>

620
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,520
<i>You can ask Luli
if you don't know something.</i>

621
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,640
<i>They never considered Lurang's feelings.</i>

622
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,120
<i>They never considered mine either.</i>

623
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,800
Lurang doesn't speak or smile much.

624
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,840
I always thought

625
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,600
that was just his personality.

626
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,320
That was until I met all of you.

627
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,720
Then I knew it wasn't
that he didn't like to smile.

628
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,000
In a family like this,

629
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,760
he could no longer be happy.

630
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,040
In truth,

631
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,520
everyone is praising me,

632
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,680
but what I want the most

633
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,040
is my brother's praise.

634
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,640
I'm grateful to all of you

635
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,280
for being my brother's friends.

636
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,200
Let me tell you a secret.

637
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,720
I had

638
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,400
to pester Zhang Lurang

639
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,360
for him to become my friend.

640
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,600
Really?

641
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Yes.

642
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,520
He is the kindest person I've ever met.

643
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,360
Rangrang.

644
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,520
Lurang.

645
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm sorry.

646
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,200
Let's go home.

647
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,560
<i>Rangrang,</i>

648
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,960
<i>I think your brother and I
get along pretty well.</i>

649
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,920
<i>How so?</i>

650
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,680
<i>That's because we have a mutual idol.</i>

651
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,280
<i>He envies me</i>

652
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,200
<i>because I can go to school with you,</i>

653
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,880
<i>take the bus with you,</i>

654
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,200
<i>and have mutual friends.</i>

655
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,200
<i>And I envy him</i>

656
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,600
<i>for having a good brother like you</i>

657
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,240
<i>who waited to pick him up from school</i>

658
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,480
<i>and tied his shoelaces.</i>

659
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,040
<i>Did Luli tell you that?</i>

660
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,080
<i>Yes.</i>

661
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,400
<i>My impression of him</i>

662
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,680
<i>was always the genius
that everyone said he was,</i>

663
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,240
<i>but I neglected the fact</i>

664
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,800
<i>that he is only 16 years old.</i>

665
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,200
<i>He said the person he admires the most</i>

666
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,520
<i>is his brother.</i>

667
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,760
<i>Rangrang, I think he has great taste.</i>

668
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,840
EXAM ADMISSION TICKET, ZHANG LULI

669
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,080
Keep looking for it.

670
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,600
If you left it at home,

671
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,760
call your parents and have them bring it.

672
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,080
It'll likely take them
half an hour though.

673
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,480
Sir, can you let me in
to take the exam first?

674
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,440
I want to let you in,
but this is the rule.

675
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,080
I can't help it.

676
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,800
There is an exam at the school ahead,

677
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,200
so traffic has been restricted.

678
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,920
I think it'll take some time to get there.

679
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,120
Sir, keep the change.

680
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,240
{\an8}Keep looking for it.

681
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,480
Your admission ticket.

682
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,760
EXAM ADMISSION TICKET

683
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,000
What are you waiting for? Hurry inside!

684
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Do your best in the exam.

685
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,680
I will.

686
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,640
Go in quickly.

687
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,800
Hurry!

688
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,520
<i>Susu, do you still remember me?</i>

689
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
<i>Where is Lili?</i>

690
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,240
<i>Lili?</i>

691
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,800
<i>Yes.</i>

692
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,160
<i>Isn't Lili your brother?</i>

693
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,200
<i>I'm extending my love to him.</i>

694
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,920
<i>He already went back.</i>

695
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,400
<i>What?</i>

696
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,880
<i>I wanted to have a fan meetup with him.</i>

697
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,000
<i>An old fan like him</i>

698
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,680
<i>and a new fan like me.</i>

699
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,600
<i>I wanted to learn more about you.</i>

700
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,160
<i>I won't get a chance now.</i>

701
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,160
<i>There will be a chance.</i>

702
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,360
<i>What?</i>

703
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,560
<i>You two will meet again.</i>

704
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
<i>It's a promise then.</i>

705
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,360
<i>Susu.</i>

706
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,640
<i>Let's go.</i>

707
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,440
<i>Today, I suddenly realized</i>

708
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,240
<i>that having an idol who spoils his fans</i>

709
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,800
<i>is such a happy thing.</i>

710
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,320
TODAY, I FINALLY REALIZED

711
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,040
THAT HAVING AN IDOL WHO SPOILS HIS FANS

712
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,080
IS SUCH A HAPPY THING.
