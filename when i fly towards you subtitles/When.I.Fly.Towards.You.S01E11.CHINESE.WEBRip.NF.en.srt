-Kiss!

00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,280
<i>Happy New Year, Rangrang.</i>

6
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,040
Dad.

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,240
You're putting up decorations
so early this year.

8
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,120
Your grandma made the decorations early

9
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,040
and sent them over,

10
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,120
so I thought I would put all of them up.

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,960
Help me see if it is okay here.

12
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,560
Move it a bit to the left.

13
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,480
To the left?

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,840
Like this?

15
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,800
Yes.

16
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,320
Okay, good. I'm pasting it now.

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,120
I'll go out
to buy Lunar New Year items later.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,680
Tell me what else we need.

19
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,520
Mom, I need a pair of shoes.

20
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,360
Didn't you buy
a pair of snow boots last year?

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,360
You haven't worn them much.

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,600
Mom, I need a new look for the new year.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,800
It's for good luck.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,240
Okay then.

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,640
Go and pick one for yourself,

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,440
so you won't complain about my taste.

27
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,400
Thank you, Mom.

28
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,480
Dear, my belt...

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,240
Your belt is still in a good state.

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,440
The color has come off.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
So I'm thinking of getting a new one

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,160
for the new year.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,600
It's for good luck.

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,840
Okay, I'll get one for you
at the mall later.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,840
Sure.

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm full of energy now. Let's continue.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,960
<i>Rangrang,</i>

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
<i>we've begun putting up decorations today.</i>

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,240
<i>What are you doing?</i>

40
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
<i>I'm doing homework.</i>

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,040
<i>Rangrang, I made dumplings today.</i>

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,520
<i>For the first time, none broke.</i>

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,320
<i>I'm guessing you're good</i>

44
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
<i>at making dumplings too.</i>

45
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,400
Is this really a dumpling?

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,360
<i>No.</i>

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,200
<i>I can't help much.</i>

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,800
<i>My parents prefer that I study.</i>

49
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,160
<i>My parents have never thought about that.</i>

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,720
<i>They just ordered me</i>

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,280
<i>to clean all the glass in the house.</i>

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,120
<i>I'm about to develop a phobia of glass.</i>

53
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,440
<i>Rangrang, what are you doing?</i>

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,560
<i>I'm reading at the library.</i>

55
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,960
<i>Rangrang,</i>

56
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,800
<i>you should do something fun</i>

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,520
<i>during the break.</i>

58
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
<i>What things are considered fun?</i>

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,800
<i>Everything that makes you happy is fun.</i>

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
<i>Today, I took Susu out</i>

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,360
<i>and watched the sunset.</i>

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,480
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,120
<i>I'm envious.</i>

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,520
<i>Envious?</i>

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,760
<i>I envy Susu.</i>

66
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,560
Lurang.

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,080
Yes?

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,400
Lurang, you're on break.

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,680
Why don't you go out?

70
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,960
Uncle and his family just left.

71
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,960
I have a lot of homework to do.

72
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,240
Is Jiangyi a fun place?

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,680
I have a friend from Jiangyi.

74
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,000
I really want to visit

75
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,520
every time he describes it to me.

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Lurang, you're staying at Uncle's house.

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,120
If you have time next semester,

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,760
shall I stay with you for a few days?

79
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,680
Mom and Dad said

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,720
you don't have many friends there yet.

81
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,160
I don't have time.

82
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,720
Is your school schedule that packed?

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,320
I've already made plans with friends

84
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
for my free time.

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,280
-You're home.
-Yes.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960
I smelled the food as I was coming in.

87
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,240
It smells so good.

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,200
Dad, you came back at the perfect time.

89
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,400
Certainly.

90
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,840
Honey,

91
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,480
didn't you go to buy cured meat?

92
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,720
Why are you back empty-handed?

93
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,080
Where is the meat?

94
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,960
I was just about to tell you.

95
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,960
My mom called me

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,400
to say that my grandma
is celebrating her birthday this year

97
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,800
and invited us home for the holiday.

98
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,280
So I'm asking for your opinion.

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,760
If we're going, we don't need the meat.

100
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,080
So I didn't buy it.

101
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,360
Great-grandma?

102
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,680
Don't you remember her?

103
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,640
She carried you in her arms
when you were little.

104
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,200
Your great-grandma back in our hometown.

105
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,200
But all our preparation will go to waste

106
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,760
if we're not celebrating in Jiangyi.

107
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,200
And if we go,

108
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,920
Uncle and his family will surely go too.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,240
Where will all of us sleep then?

110
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
I return to work
on the fifth day after Lunar New Year.

111
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Won't we be spending most of our time

112
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,120
on the road?

113
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,840
Yes, it will be troublesome.

114
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,840
You're right.

115
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,360
Suyang is quite a distance away
from Jiangyi.

116
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,120
Suyang?

117
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,440
Don't hesitate then!

118
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,760
We must go!

119
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,200
Great-grandma used to carry me.

120
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,160
It's her birthday.

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,120
How can we not go

122
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,440
when so many others are going?

123
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,160
Reunion is the most important thing
during Lunar New Year.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
-You were just...
-I was considering it just now.

125
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,320
Now I've made up my mind.

126
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I don't mind
squeezing in somewhere to sleep.

127
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,880
Attending is the most important.

128
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,360
Look,

129
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,880
our child has suddenly become so sensible.

130
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,720
That's settled then.

131
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,440
We're spending Lunar New Year in Suyang

132
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,000
and coming back the next day, okay?

133
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,440
Okay.

134
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,760
I'm done eating.

135
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,480
I'll pack for the trip to Suyang.

136
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,800
Are you packing right now?

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,280
This girl.

138
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,800
Why is she suddenly so excited about it?

139
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,320
The cohesion of the family, I guess.

140
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,280
<i>Rangrang!</i>

141
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,120
<i>Today, I finished</i>

142
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,520
<i>all the Chinese assignments.</i>

143
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,880
<i>Let me test you.</i>

144
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,560
What test?

145
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,440
A word game.

146
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,480
I'll go first.

147
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,600
Beyond your wildest dreams.

148
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,560
A dream come true.

149
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,600
I know what you're implying.

150
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,160
It's my turn.

151
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,600
Time passes slowly.

152
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,280
Slow on the uptake.

153
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,640
Rangrang, are you insulting me?

154
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
<i>Do you want to continue?</i>

155
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,080
You can't take advantage of the game

156
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,280
to do that.

157
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,600
I'll forgive you this time.

158
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,480
But I'm starting fresh.

159
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,040
Put into practice.

160
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,160
Practice makes perfect.

161
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,000
<i>Kung Fu Panda.</i>

162
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,960
<i>Tom and Jerry.</i>

163
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,320
Rangrang, don't just give random answers.

164
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,360
<i>That's not the rule.</i>

165
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, forget it.

166
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Rangrang, you have a bad temper.

167
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,640
Only I can put up with you.

168
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
<i>I'll forgive you</i>

169
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,680
<i>as long as you buy me bubble tea</i>

170
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,240
<i>when I am in Suyang.</i>

171
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,760
Are you coming to Suyang?

172
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,720
Yes.

173
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,440
We're visiting our relatives,

174
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,320
so we'll celebrate Lunar New Year there.

175
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,720
Zhang Lurang, are you very surprised

176
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,640
as well as

177
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,840
<i>a little bit happy?</i>

178
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,000
<i>Don't be shy.</i>

179
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,400
<i>Just say so or I wouldn't know.</i>

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,720
Suyang is a boring place.

181
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,360
How can it be boring if you're there?

182
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Good night.

183
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,120
Good night.

184
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm looking forward to Lunar New Year.

185
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,120
I'll get in the car first.

186
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,160
Put it here.

187
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,440
Dad, how long will the drive take?

188
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,360
Four hours if there is no traffic jam.

189
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,600
We'll arrive in the afternoon.

190
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,240
<i>Rangrang, I'm setting off.</i>

191
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,360
<i>I heard</i>

192
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,560
that Luli ranked first

193
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,160
in the final exam this semester again.

194
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,640
He participated in a competition
before the final exams,

195
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,160
so he didn't have much time to revise

196
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,600
and ended up ranking third in the city.

197
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
His ranking dropped slightly.

198
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,640
Are you still not satisfied?

199
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,360
Luli excels in his studies
and is obedient.

200
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,960
We would be over the moon
if we were in your shoes.

201
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,200
He's disciplined.

202
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,720
We don't worry much about him.

203
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,760
Luli, tutor your cousin
when you have time.

204
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,800
He even struggles
with the holiday homework.

205
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,720
Okay.

206
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,440
You've always been a good boy.

207
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,280
Where is Lurang?

208
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,440
How did he do in the exams?

209
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,640
Lurang...

210
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,200
Aunt, Uncle.

211
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,480
Hello.

212
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,680
Lurang is still as quiet as before.

213
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,440
It's not good for him.

214
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,360
He should learn from Luli.

215
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,640
Be more cheerful.

216
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
That's just how he is.

217
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,040
But he's obedient and sensible.

218
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,400
Isn't he studying in Jiangyi
this semester?

219
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,080
What was his ranking in the final exam?

220
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,440
I heard
that only the top five in his school

221
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,000
have a chance
to enter East China University.

222
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,040
Lurang,

223
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,280
take Luli and your cousins
to the library this afternoon.

224
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,680
Pick out some books for them.

225
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,360
Have Luli take them.

226
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,640
I have plans in the afternoon.

227
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm going back to my room.

228
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,160
Lurang hasn't been close to us
since he was little.

229
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,560
It might be hard for him
to get along with his classmates.

230
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
He has friends.

231
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
He's doing quite well at school.

232
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,600
Mom,

233
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,480
I'll go back to my room and study.

234
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,760
Go ahead.

235
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,800
Enjoy the food.

236
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,240
<i>I've arrived in Suyang.</i>

237
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,960
<i>Now I'm going to take a nap.</i>

238
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,120
<i>I'll see you tonight.</i>

239
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,920
Mom, please let me be.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Your aunt will be back very late tonight.

241
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,800
Your dad and I have to clean up the place.

242
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,040
Just take Xuanxuan to the supermarket

243
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,520
to buy some seeds, nuts, and snacks.

244
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,760
It's not that hard.

245
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,320
But I've changed into my pajamas.

246
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,880
I want to take a nap.

247
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,960
If you nap now,

248
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
you won't sleep tonight.

249
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,720
I can go by myself. I know the way.

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,200
Come on. Go with him. Hurry up.

251
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,360
Aren't you going to get changed?

252
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,240
It's fine.

253
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,600
No one knows me here anyway.

254
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,800
But...

255
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,840
It's not appropriate, is it?

256
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,680
Why don't you wait for me on the side?

257
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,960
Don't worry. I can handle this myself...

258
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,920
Everyone, are you ready?

259
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,720
The countdown for the big sale starts now.

260
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,880
Ten,

261
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,080
nine,

262
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,800
eight,

263
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,080
seven,

264
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,320
six,

265
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,320
five,

266
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,360
four,

267
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,240
three, two, one.

268
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,560
Begin!

269
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,880
{\an8}30-SECOND FLASH SALE!
HALF OFF EVERYTHING!

270
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,240
This is nice.

271
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,240
-I grabbed this first.
-What?

272
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,800
-I got it first.
-I grabbed it first.

273
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,760
Let go!

274
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,200
-I got it first.
-I got it first.

275
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,120
-It's mine.
-You're being unreasonable, young lady.

276
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
-I got it first.
-I took it first.

277
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,440
-I grabbed it first.
-I did.

278
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,320
-I got it first.
-Let go.

279
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,280
Su Zaizai?

280
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,480
-I...
-Will you drop it?

281
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,600
This is not bad.

282
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,440
-I got it this time!
-Who wants this?

283
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Rangrang, please don't get the wrong idea.

284
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm not usually dressed like this at home.

285
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,800
I happened to not dress up today

286
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,400
and ran into you.

287
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,160
No, you've always looked like this.

288
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,960
You remembered it wrong.

289
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,200
My cousin has a bad memory.

290
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,240
I planned to study

291
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,840
after taking a nap

292
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,440
and then meet up with you tonight.

293
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,280
I didn't expect to bump into you here.

294
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
You haven't started your holiday homework,

295
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,960
let alone study.

296
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,640
Except for math,

297
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,800
I've almost finished everything else.

298
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,520
I'm not as good as you at math,

299
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,240
so I'm slow.

300
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,760
Are you good at math?

301
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,320
{\an8}I like math too.

302
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
{\an8}But no one in our family is good at it.

303
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,360
Su Zaizai always
barely passes her math exams.

304
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,360
Little brat.

305
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,920
Don't embarrass me.

306
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,240
{\an8}She never knows the answer
when I ask her math questions.

307
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,920
But she's really good at English.

308
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,000
I always failed my English exams.

309
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,720
And she has been helping me.

310
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,440
Everyone has their own strengths

311
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,920
and weaknesses.

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
That's normal.

313
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,200
Zaizai, are you that good at English?

314
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,680
Of course.

315
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,280
I just don't brag about it.

316
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,720
Rangrang, my aunt's place is up ahead.

317
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,280
Do you want to come over?

318
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,800
Right now?

319
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,880
Please come.

320
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,400
I need your help with my homework.

321
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,680
Are you in a hurry to go home?

322
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,520
No. Let's go.

323
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,520
Rangrang, look.

324
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,040
We've encountered

325
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,280
the most secretive intelligence community
in the world.

326
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,480
What do you mean?

327
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,240
The literal meaning.

328
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,640
Let's go.

329
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,080
What?

330
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,280
A boy?

331
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,000
And they're on their way here?

332
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,200
Okay, got it.

333
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,520
Thank you so much.

334
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,160
What boy were you talking about?

335
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,040
Zaizai's uncle's
third aunt's sister's neighbor

336
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,280
said she saw Zaizai with a boy

337
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
talking and laughing on their way here.

338
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
They seemed quite close.

339
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
Uncle's third aunt...

340
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,800
Who is that?

341
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
That's not the point.

342
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,120
Zaizai is still young.

343
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,040
She's bringing a boy home all of a sudden.

344
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,960
Did she just meet this boy?

345
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,000
How is his character?

346
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,240
How is his family?

347
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,960
Does he have any bad habits?

348
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,320
We're clueless about him.

349
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,560
It's dangerous.

350
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,760
He also got Zaizai to bring him home

351
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,160
right after they met.

352
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,680
This guy can't be good.

353
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,480
That's exactly what I meant.

354
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,520
Unacceptable.

355
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,640
I must teach him a lesson.

356
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,560
I...

357
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,359
We shall see if he can take a beating.

358
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,319
Okay.

359
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,440
Only my parents
should be at home right now.

360
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,800
Don't worry. They are very friendly.

361
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,400
Stop right there.

362
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,360
Nice to meet you, Mr. Su.

363
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,960
I'm Su Zaizai's classmate.

364
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,640
My name is Zhang Lurang.

365
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,400
Zhang Lurang?

366
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,000
He has been tutoring me

367
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,200
in math and physics.

368
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,160
He's very smart.

369
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,600
Is he the classmate you mentioned?

370
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,960
Why didn't you inform us
that your friend was coming over?

371
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,920
I...

372
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,240
Does the lantern look a bit tilted?

373
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,440
Xiaozhang.

374
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,320
Come on in!

375
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,560
Why are you standing outside?

376
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,880
-Come in and take a seat.
-Quickly. Make yourself at home.

377
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,320
Please take a seat.

378
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,680
Make yourself at home.

379
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,720
Take a seat.

380
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,880
Make yourself comfortable.

381
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,760
Xiaozhang,

382
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,720
are you in the same class as Zaizai?

383
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,280
No.

384
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,480
I can tell he's a good boy.

385
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,520
Zaizai is very weak

386
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,320
in science.

387
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm grateful to you for tutoring her.

388
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,600
It's nothing.

389
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,600
She helps me too.

390
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,840
Well, they help each other.

391
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Exactly.

392
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,280
Where is Zaizai?

393
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,880
What were you talking about?

394
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,920
I just changed into some casual clothes.

395
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,240
This is the least casual outfit
I have seen you in.

396
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,280
Rangrang, can you come to my room

397
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,560
and help me with my homework?

398
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,720
"Rangrang"?

399
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,760
Yes.

400
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
I heard Zaizai calling him Rangrang...

401
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,040
Don't you need to do your homework?

402
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Go ahead. Go now.

403
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,120
Xiaozhang,

404
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,360
since you're here,

405
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,080
please stay for dinner.

406
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,880
You can try Zaizai's dad's cooking.

407
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,360
I won't stay for dinner.

408
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,000
It's getting late.

409
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,200
Yes, stay and have dinner with us.

410
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,400
I'm cooking.

411
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,640
You can try it.

412
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
Zaizai,

413
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,400
be my helper.

414
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,400
Okay.

415
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,280
You should stay.

416
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,080
Sit here and entertain your friend.

417
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I'll help him.

418
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,680
Xiaozhang, is there anything
you don't eat?

419
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,720
He can't eat shrimp.

420
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,200
Okay, all right.

421
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,840
How did you know?

422
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,960
Whenever we ate at Mrs. Guan's place,

423
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,560
you never ate the shrimp balls.

424
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,360
So I asked Gu Ran.

425
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,440
Do you suddenly realize

426
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,200
that I'm caring and attentive

427
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,680
aside from being cheerful?

428
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,720
Is that so funny?

429
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Where is Zaizai?

430
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,560
I asked her to see Xiaozhang out.

431
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,560
Someone said

432
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,720
{\an8}this must be a bad boy

433
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,200
{\an8}who harbors evil intentions.

434
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,400
Then you kept calling him Xiaozhang.

435
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,400
You changed your attitude quickly enough.

436
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,640
You must take the actual situation
into consideration.

437
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,840
Look at Xiaozhang's appearance,

438
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,320
demeanor, and attitude.

439
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,720
Would he be a bad boy?

440
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,200
Besides,

441
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,600
he's tutoring Zaizai in math.

442
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,320
He's such a kind kid.

443
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,040
Let me tell you.

444
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,280
I wanted a boyfriend like him

445
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,880
when I was Zaizai's age.

446
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,800
And you're so lucky.

447
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,400
You found one.

448
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,880
Rangrang, did my parents

449
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,560
make you uncomfortable during dinner?

450
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,960
That's just how my family is.

451
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,840
They can never stay quiet for a minute.

452
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,800
That's good.

453
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,880
Good?

454
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,440
My family

455
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,160
usually doesn't talk to each other.

456
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,520
We focus on our own things.

457
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,120
Even having meals

458
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,240
feels like completing a daily task.

459
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,120
We gather at a place at fixed times.

460
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,440
So you don't talk to each other.

461
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,240
Isn't that boring?

462
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,840
Yes, it's quite boring.

463
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,920
Rangrang, you get the privilege with me.

464
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,560
You're now my first contact.

465
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,840
You get priority to chat with me.

466
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,520
Call me any time

467
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,920
you want to talk to someone.

468
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,200
Rangrang,

469
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,440
does meeting me in Suyang

470
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,320
count as an interesting event

471
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,040
during your boring holiday?

472
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,400
Yes.

473
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,440
<i>And I bagged it myself.</i>

474
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,920
<i>Right?</i>

475
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,880
<i>Or maybe they couldn't see me.</i>

476
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,920
<i>I was also too rash.</i>

477
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
<i>There was a new cat.</i>

478
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,040
<i>I also chipped in.</i>

479
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,600
<i>-Nice!
-And I had an idea.</i>

480
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,280
Mom, your favorite sketch

481
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,600
is about to end.

482
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,800
How is the patient doing now?

483
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay.

484
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,200
Okay, I'll be right there.

485
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,040
A patient has had an adverse reaction.

486
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,400
I need to head to the hospital.

487
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,880
Honey, do the dishes.

488
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,600
Be careful on the road.

489
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,600
Okay.

490
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,960
But it's Lunar New Year's Eve today.

491
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,960
The Emergency Department is always busy.

492
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,720
Your mom has no choice.

493
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,560
I meant

494
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,200
that she hasn't tried the dumplings

495
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,520
that I made this afternoon.

496
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,960
She's missing out.

497
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,560
You can save some for her.

498
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,920
Hello.

499
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,400
It's okay. I'm free to talk.

500
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,440
You should pay attention to your sickness.

501
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,920
Don't go out often.

502
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,400
The weather is cold now

503
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,680
and can damage your lungs.

504
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,640
Yes.

505
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,040
One more thing.

506
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,160
Be careful with your diet too.

507
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,080
Avoid overly sweet, spicy,

508
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,760
or salty foods.

509
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,080
<i>Welcome the Lunar New Year</i>

510
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,920
<i>with joyfulness.</i>

511
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,360
<i>May you have a happy Lunar New Year</i>

512
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,320
<i>and a delightful Lunar New Year's Eve.</i>

513
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,800
<i>Your happiness brings me joy.</i>

514
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,520
<i>Your happiness sweetens my days.</i>

515
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,280
<i>Wishing you a Happy Lunar New Year</i>

516
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,000
<i>in the Year of the Dragon.</i>

517
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,280
<i>Hello, Gu Ran.</i>

518
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,040
That's so insincere.

519
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,280
You just forwarded
Lunar New Year's greetings

520
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,440
without revising the zodiac year.

521
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,560
Sorry.

522
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,440
I'm lighting fireworks with others.

523
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,440
What are you doing?

524
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,840
Did you light fireworks?

525
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,560
Fireworks aren't allowed in the city.

526
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,760
You know that.

527
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,080
Then you can listen to them.

528
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,640
<i>Listen. Did you hear it?</i>

529
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,880
Yes.

530
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,440
Why don't you watch
the Lunar New Year's Gala inside?

531
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,360
What are you looking at out here?

532
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,480
Grandma,

533
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,480
I always feel

534
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,160
that every Lunar New Year is the same.

535
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,320
Everyone eats, sets off fireworks,

536
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,480
and watches the Gala.

537
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,480
They don't even change the sequence.

538
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,360
But why do people

539
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,080
still look forward to the Lunar New Year?

540
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,280
That's because today is a day

541
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,080
that everyone chooses to spend

542
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,360
with people who are worth it.

543
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,120
Don't you think

544
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,760
wishing "Happy Lunar New Year"

545
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,560
to the same person every year

546
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,160
is a fortunate thing?

547
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,000
So I'm really fortunate.

548
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,840
{\an8}Happy Lunar New Year, Grandma.

549
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,400
{\an8}Happy Lunar New Year.

550
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,160
Hello, Rangrang.

551
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,360
<i>It's time for the countdown.</i>

552
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,040
<i>Five,</i>

553
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,480
<i>four,</i>

554
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,840
<i>three,</i>

555
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,360
two,

556
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,320
one.

557
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,880
Happy Lunar New Year, Rangrang.

558
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,920
Happy Lunar New Year, Su Zaizai.

559
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
<i>I wish we could do a video call.</i>

560
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,440
<i>Then you could see it.</i>

561
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
Jiang Jia.

562
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
Happy Lunar New Year.

563
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,800
Happy Lunar New Year.

564
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,120
{\an8}-Take this.
-Great-grandma.

565
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,040
-I can't take the red packet.
-Zaizai.

566
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
Just take it.

567
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,800
Your great-grandma is so fond of you.

568
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,960
You really don't have to.

569
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,520
These eggs don't cost much.

570
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,920
Just take them.

571
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,680
Otherwise, she won't be able

572
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,160
to sleep tonight.

573
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,520
All right. We'll take them.

574
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
-Take it.
-Zaizai, take it.

575
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,760
Thank you, Great-grandma.

576
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,640
It's getting late. We're heading back.

577
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,080
-Sure.
-We'll visit when we have time.

578
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,560
Okay.

579
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,840
See you.

580
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,000
Bye, Aunt. Bye, Great-grandma.

581
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,480
Drive safely.

582
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,960
What's the point
of celebrating Lunar New Year?

583
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,160
It's to bond with people.

584
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,120
Your room is smelly.

585
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,280
What kind of smell?

586
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,240
You haven't moved at all
during the holiday.

587
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,160
So what do you think?

588
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,160
It's a sour smell.

589
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,640
Get up.

590
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,800
Bring the things with you.

591
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,360
We'll pay a Lunar New Year's visit

592
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,920
to Dr. Gu.

593
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,480
He took good care of your grandma

594
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,120
when she was in the hospital.

595
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,240
We should be grateful.

596
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,560
Get up now.

597
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,560
Just say that you want me

598
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,760
to carry things for you.

599
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,680
-Let's go.
-Good. There you go.

600
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,720
You're more sensible after Lunar New Year.

601
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,520
<i>A New Year's visit?
Are you visiting your relatives?</i>

602
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,680
<i>No, it's my grandma's doctor.</i>

603
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,520
<i>My dad said we must express our gratitude.</i>

604
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,160
<i>I can't talk. I'm almost there</i>

605
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,000
<i>and this fruit basket weighs a ton.</i>

606
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,720
<i>Your dad sure knows you well.</i>

607
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,840
<i>What do you mean?</i>

608
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,600
<i>It would be a waste of your brawn</i>

609
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,320
<i>if you didn't carry the fruit basket.</i>

610
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,160
<i>You should be glad</i>

611
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,440
<i>that you're not here right now.</i>

612
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,080
<i>Otherwise, you wouldn't be laughing.</i>

613
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,240
Jiang Jia, come.

614
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,520
Come here. I found it.

615
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,920
<i>I was also too rash.</i>

616
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,520
Ranran, see who it is.

617
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,640
<i>I also chipped in.</i>

618
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,600
<i>Nice!</i>

619
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,760
<i>And I had an idea.</i>

620
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,040
<i>I'll create a club.</i>

621
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,960
<i>What?</i>

622
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,960
<i>Why don't you crawl
out of the screen and hit me?</i>

623
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,680
-Look at this one.
-Okay.

624
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,640
Hello.

625
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,920
I'm looking for Dr. Gu.

626
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,280
No way.

627
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,160
You did crawl out of the screen.

628
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
Gu Ran?

629
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,360
Do you know each other?

630
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,040
<i>Rangrang, what are you looking at?</i>

631
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,440
<i>You're completely absorbed.</i>

632
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,000
<i>I just feel</i>

633
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,600
<i>that fireworks are beautiful.</i>

634
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,080
<i>Haven't you played with fireworks
during Lunar New Year before?</i>

635
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,320
<i>No.</i>

636
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,480
<i>So will you think of me</i>

637
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,760
<i>whenever you see fireworks?</i>

638
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,640
<i>This Lunar New Year, my wish</i>

639
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,280
<i>is that fireworks factories don't sell out</i>

640
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,760
<i>before I turn 100.</i>
