00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,040
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

4
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,080
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,920
<i>If Only Heroes Could Be More Normal.</i>

6
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,360
What a coincidence.

7
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,480
Is this your son?

8
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,520
That's right.

9
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,480
Here, have some water.

10
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,600
And I've also met Jiajia before.

11
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,960
It was that time at the hospital.

12
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,120
Talk about fate.

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,120
It's so serendipitous.

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,720
Jiajia, when did you go to the hospital?

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,120
It was when Zaizai got hurt.

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,080
Right.

17
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,720
I think one of their friends got injured.

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Jiajia,

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,640
no need to be shy.

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,520
Just make yourself at home.

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,840
Ranran always acts so casually at home.

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,880
Yes, he does.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,080
Here you go.

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,120
So how was the traffic

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,120
on your way here?

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,920
It's the holidays.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,080
There weren't many people.

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,240
-Yes, fewer cars.
-Fewer people are going to work.

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,039
Ranran,

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,919
you've been studying the whole morning.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,600
Your friend has come to visit.

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,800
You should greet her.

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,760
Ranran, you can show Jiajia to your room.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,480
You have a lot of games, right?

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,600
Go and play, you guys.

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
Surely, you will find
the adults' conversation boring.

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,760
Yes.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,400
Go on.

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,880
Okay.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,800
Jiajia, go on.

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,800
Go on.

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,240
Feel free to look around.

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,640
Is this the homework

44
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,120
you told your mom
that you worked on all morning?

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,840
It's normal

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,520
for a guy's room to be a little messy.

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,960
You were obviously playing games.

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,240
This photo.

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,400
I know it's hard to believe.

50
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,680
But that was a candid photo.

51
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,880
This is Shen Qianyu, right?

52
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,840
He looks so good in a snapshot.

53
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,760
Do you have games on your computer?

54
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,120
Are you really asking that?

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,880
For a guy who's always on trend,

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,440
I have all the good games.

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
Do you have <i>GKART</i>?

58
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,600
Your computer is on.

59
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,560
I was just using it to...

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,680
That's better.

61
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,400
GKART

62
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,400
{\an8}GKART

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
What are you...

64
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,680
I...

65
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,280
Do you see how nice I am?

66
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,720
I found the game for you.

67
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,120
I get it.

68
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,600
What?

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,240
It's not very proper

70
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,040
to do it openly in the daytime.

71
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,480
That's much too bold.

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,240
But I totally get it.

73
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,040
Just be careful next time.

74
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,640
Wait, no!

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,560
Jiang Jia, what were you thinking of?

76
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,920
Who told you these things?

77
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,600
There is no need to be shy.

78
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,560
I'm not some stranger.

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,480
Forget about the game.

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
You should review online classes

81
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
to clean your dirty mind.

82
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Wait! I haven't logged in to my account!

83
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,200
What's your problem?

84
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,120
I am a positive young man.
Do you have a problem with that?

85
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,880
I am playing this game today!

86
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,960
My mom is getting better every day.

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,520
Her appetite has improved a lot.

88
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,640
She has even gained weight.

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,280
Dr. Gu, without your help,

90
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,960
my family wouldn't be celebrating
this new year.

91
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,600
You speak too highly of me.

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,760
I was just doing my job

93
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
as a doctor.

94
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,800
She recovered quickly

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,160
because of her good physique.

96
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,160
That's right.

97
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,600
I wonder if the kids are hungry.

98
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,240
Shall I prepare some fruit for them?

99
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,240
They're having fun.

100
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,480
You shouldn't disturb them.

101
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,480
If they're hungry,

102
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,640
Ranran will take care of it.

103
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,120
Look,

104
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,160
your son is so disciplined,

105
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,200
unlike Jiajia.

106
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,760
She always makes us worry.

107
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,080
Jiajia is a sensible kid.

108
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,200
She's also well-behaved.

109
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,600
As for Ranran,

110
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
he's good at taking care of girls.

111
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,960
You don't have to worry
about them hanging out.

112
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,600
You're right.

113
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Otherwise, they wouldn't
have gotten along, right?

114
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,280
-Yes.
-Listen.

115
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,720
Jiajia is a quiet, reserved girl.

116
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,400
She never argues with others.

117
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Right.

118
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,200
Let go of it right now!

119
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,240
You let go of my hair!

120
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,960
Just you wait!

121
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,440
How could you bite me?

122
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,040
I think I should get them fruit.

123
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,240
Yes.

124
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,280
Get some fruit for them.

125
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
Where were we?

126
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,520
Well...

127
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,640
What do the elderly
have to pay more attention to?

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,760
That's right.

129
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,000
There are some things.

130
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,040
Particularly conditions
related to the respiratory tract.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,080
Good morning.

132
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,520
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, sir.

133
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,080
It's the first lesson of the semester.

134
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Let's review first.

135
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,840
The flu has been quite bad lately.

136
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,440
We should take more precautions.

137
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,800
Though the weather is warming up...

138
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,760
-We're still acclimatizing
-...make sure to continue layering up.

139
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,280
to the new classroom.

140
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
We can't let our guard down.

141
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
Class rep,
come get some vinegar during the break

142
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
-and fumigate the classroom.
-Okay.

143
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,560
Let's continue.

144
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,520
What is it?

145
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,680
Are you playing charades?

146
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,920
Just spit it out.

147
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,920
Ranran,

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,360
the flu season is ramping up.

149
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,640
Your dad and I

150
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,280
plan to go to Huiyuan to help out.

151
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,080
It's not that serious.

152
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
We're just going to support them.

153
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Yes.

154
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,960
But it's quite urgent.

155
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,120
We have to leave tomorrow.

156
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,760
How long will you be away?

157
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
At most, half a month.

158
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,120
Just over a month if needed.

159
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
It sounds pretty cool.

160
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,720
You could be interviewed on television.

161
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,039
If so, let me know.

162
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,400
I'll brag to my friends.

163
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,799
That would be amazing.

164
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,159
See? I told you he would be okay with it.

165
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,000
He can't wait for us to go away

166
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,720
so he can have all the freedom.

167
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,000
Not to that extent.

168
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,360
Maybe just a little.

169
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,520
Okay, eat.

170
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,800
Today's dishes are quite spicy.

171
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,400
{\an8}Here you go. Eat this.

172
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,440
{\an8}This isn't spicy.

173
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,320
You're such a picky eater.

174
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,840
HUIYUAN CITY

175
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,440
Honey,

176
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,680
{\an8}we should pack some warmer clothes.

177
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,400
{\an8}Yes, it's cold there.

178
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
{\an8}Let's go get them.

179
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,760
999 GANMAOLING COLD REMEDY GRANULES

180
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,080
So are both your parents away?

181
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,360
Yes. They won't be back
for at least half a month.

182
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,800
Won't you feel bored by yourself?

183
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,800
Not at all.

184
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,880
They were often away working overtime.

185
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm used to it.

186
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,040
Besides, I get to do whatever I want.

187
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,760
Nobody will nag me
for playing video games.

188
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,080
I'll get to play the new mode

189
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,440
in <i>Crossfire</i>.

190
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,600
Well?

191
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,640
Let's play tonight.

192
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,120
Of course!

193
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,560
No.

194
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,120
I have to help my grandma close up.

195
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,840
Lurang.

196
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,480
What about you? Do you want to come?

197
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,400
I'll pass.

198
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,240
Are you also busy tonight?

199
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,040
I have homework.

200
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,720
It looks like none of you

201
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,240
get to enjoy the freedom.

202
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,320
What are you up to?

203
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
Jiang Jia.

204
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
Xiaojiang.

205
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,040
Jiajia.

206
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,080
The best Jia.

207
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,880
<i>I'm doing math homework.</i>

208
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,480
<i>I just thought of the answer,</i>

209
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,080
<i>but you disrupted my train of thought.</i>

210
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,320
<i>Can you give it a rest?</i>

211
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,360
Hello? How can I help you, Ms. Chen?

212
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,600
<i>Ranran, are you doing okay by yourself?</i>

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,520
I'm as good as I can be.

214
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,920
I just had dinner with friends.

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,920
I just got home.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,880
<i>That's good.</i>

217
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,640
<i>There's cash in the drawer in our room.</i>

218
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,680
<i>Take it if you need it.</i>

219
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,160
<i>Buy your friends something to eat.</i>

220
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,440
Don't worry.

221
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,200
I surely will.

222
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,760
<i>Dr. Chen, there's an emergency.</i>

223
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,120
<i>I'm coming.</i>

224
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,240
<i>Ranran, I just called to check on you.</i>

225
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,000
<i>Your dad and I are busy. I have to go.</i>

226
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,800
<i>Don't stay up too late. Sleep early.</i>

227
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,360
Are you...

228
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,160
You're so busy.

229
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
Well? Did you manage to get through?

230
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
No.

231
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
That's odd.

232
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,520
He kept sending me texts

233
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,080
to harass me an hour ago.

234
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,720
Now I can't get in touch with him.

235
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,720
Is he already asleep?

236
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,440
Harass you? Like what?

237
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,640
Maybe something did happen to him.

238
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,240
Did you say

239
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,520
that both his parents are away?

240
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,840
He must not be used to being home alone.

241
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,520
I think you should go check on him.

242
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,080
Grandma,

243
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,480
you worry too much.

244
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,400
He was bragging to us this morning

245
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,840
that he can do whatever he wants

246
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,320
without supervision.

247
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,040
Did you just take his word for that?

248
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,560
No wonder.

249
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,840
No wonder what?

250
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,600
No wonder you couldn't

251
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,040
make any friends before.

252
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
Gu Ran's address?

253
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,000
<i>Yes. You went to his house before, right?</i>

254
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,920
<i>Give me his address.</i>

255
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,240
I'll send it to you.

256
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,960
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

257
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,000
<i>Hang on.</i>

258
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,440
<i>You aren't busy right now, are you?</i>

259
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,640
Why?

260
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,240
Stop rushing me. I'm already here.

261
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,560
You're just being paranoid.

262
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,520
He's a grown person. What could happen?

263
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,840
Just get here.

264
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,120
I was halfway through watching a drama.

265
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,960
Gu Ran.

266
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,800
Gu Ran!

267
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,960
So you are home. Why didn't you pick up?

268
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Are you sleeping?

269
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,160
You're burning.

270
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,240
Hello, Guan Fang. Gu Ran has a fever.

271
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,440
Are you almost here?

272
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,880
<i>I'm not sure. There is traffic up ahead.</i>

273
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,320
I'll try to cool him down physically.

274
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
There should be fever medication here.

275
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
If the fever persists,

276
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,240
we'll take him to the hospital.

277
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,280
<i>Okay.</i>

278
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,280
Normally, you're quite annoying.

279
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,200
But you look pitiful when you're sick.

280
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,080
You're awake.

281
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,080
Do you feel better?

282
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,640
I feel much better.

283
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,880
Why are you here?

284
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,480
Don't you remember letting me in?

285
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,040
My goodness.

286
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,440
Were you sleepwalking just now

287
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,800
and simply opened the door?

288
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,400
Actually, Guan Fang couldn't reach you,

289
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,520
so he got worried
and asked me to check on you.

290
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,720
Thank goodness I live nearby

291
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,320
or else you would've burned to bits

292
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,320
before he got here.

293
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,240
Thank goodness.

294
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,120
Anyway, why isn't Guan Fang here yet?

295
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,320
My legs are numb.

296
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,320
Guan Fang should be here.

297
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,440
I'll go outside to get him.

298
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,440
Okay.

299
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,000
May I ask

300
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,160
what you are doing?

301
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,160
Good question.

302
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,640
Since you will be living alone

303
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,680
for half a month,

304
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
the probability
of similar incidents happening again

305
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,240
will be very high.

306
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,760
I know my grandma too well.

307
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,000
She will definitely ask me
to check on you every day.

308
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,200
So for the sake of my own sanity,

309
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,480
I'm going to pack you up

310
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,640
and take you to my house.

311
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,640
What?

312
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,760
But that's not a good idea.

313
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,320
I don't want to trouble your grandma.

314
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,560
-Besides...
-She heard you were coming.

315
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,840
So she has made braised pork knuckles,

316
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,840
fried shrimp,

317
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,040
steamed sea bass,

318
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,240
spiced beef,

319
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,440
and dumplings.

320
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,600
What are we waiting for?

321
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,760
Let's go.

322
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,280
Don't you have a spare room?

323
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,120
This is just fine.

324
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,760
We have enough space on the floor.

325
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,240
And he won't roll off the bed.

326
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,960
I didn't know you were so good to him.

327
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,960
You even brought him home
to look after him.

328
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,080
I just don't want my grandma to nag me.

329
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,880
I'm not that happy to sleep with him.

330
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,760
It's not like I enjoy
looking after a patient.

331
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,880
Where is Gu Ran?

332
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,840
I think he's outside on the phone.

333
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,720
<i>Yes, based on the current situation,</i>

334
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,120
<i>it will be another two weeks</i>

335
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,080
<i>before we can go home.</i>

336
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,440
-Today, I...
<i>-That's right.</i>

337
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,440
<i>If the hospital
or a patient's family calls,</i>

338
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,840
<i>remember to note it down.</i>

339
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,240
<i>Urgent matters cannot be delayed.</i>

340
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
I've got it.

341
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,000
Okay.

342
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,200
Don't move.

343
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,280
The view of you seemed to tell a story

344
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,720
before you turned around.

345
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,720
But not if I turn around?

346
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,360
Turned around,

347
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
it's "yrots."

348
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,600
Why are you moody again

349
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
after only a few minutes?

350
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,720
Even you could tell so easily.

351
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,160
Yet they couldn't.

352
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,080
I often suspect

353
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,720
that patients are more important

354
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
to my parents than I am.

355
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
{\an8}Do you know?

356
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,960
{\an8}When I was little,
they always worked late.

357
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,440
I was alone before I fell asleep.

358
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,320
I was still alone after I woke up.

359
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,920
When I was unhappy,

360
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,760
I would hide in a corner at home,

361
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,320
imagining their frantic looks

362
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,680
when they came home from work

363
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,840
and couldn't find me.

364
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,840
But even after I woke up from my sleep,

365
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,320
they still weren't home yet.

366
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,440
So I could only go back to bed,

367
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,800
hugging my pillow.

368
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Even now, they still have no idea

369
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,920
about the countless hide-and-seek games

370
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
that I have played with them.

371
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
That's because they have never found me.

372
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,120
Hence, I kept winning again and again.

373
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,080
How I wish I could lose once.

374
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
I guess I won today.

375
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,520
I found you.

376
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,080
You should've told me.

377
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,520
I'm an expert at hide-and-seek.

378
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,040
Next time, ask me to play.

379
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,640
But I'm not going to play for nothing.

380
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,600
If you lose, you have to buy me snacks.

381
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,320
You're smiling.

382
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,880
Does that mean...

383
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,600
Thanks to you, I'm feeling better.

384
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,960
Good.

385
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,880
You look better

386
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,800
when you smile.

387
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,120
It's late.

388
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,240
Drink this milk and go to bed.

389
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,640
-Thank you, Mrs. Guan.
-Thank you, Grandma.

390
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,600
Make sure you cover yourself
when you sleep.

391
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,760
You don't want to get a cold.

392
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
Okay.

393
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,920
What are you doing?

394
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,120
You're blushing.

395
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,840
Are you still feverish?

396
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,040
No.

397
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,760
My fever is gone.

398
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840
But your face is really red.

399
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,320
Your heart is beating fast.

400
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,920
It's not normal.

401
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,320
Very abnormal.

402
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,240
I'm really fine.

403
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,520
Go to sleep, okay?

404
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,880
I'm not a stranger. Don't be shy.

405
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,800
Just let me see.

406
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,200
Let me feel you.

407
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,760
Where are you touching?

408
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,360
Go to sleep. Stop touching me!

409
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,640
-Let me touch.
-Stop it. Go to sleep.

410
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,600
Go to sleep.

411
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,320
Stop touching me!

412
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,560
You have a fever!

413
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,920
Let me feel you.

414
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,040
<i>Zhang Lurang, you've known Gu Ran
for a long time.</i>

415
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,080
<i>How do you put up with him?</i>

416
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,800
<i>Lurang, did you know?</i>

417
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,880
<i>Guan Fang snores like a trumpet at night.</i>

418
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,240
<i>Like a trumpet. Do you know?</i>

419
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,840
<i>If Gu Ran wasn't breathing,</i>

420
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,000
<i>I would've thought he became a mutant.</i>

421
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,200
<i>Last night, he kicked me.</i>

422
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,080
<i>My waist is all bruised.</i>

423
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,840
<i>Come and sort him out for me.</i>

424
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,440
<i>I just recovered from being sick.</i>

425
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,400
<i>Aren't you going to visit me?</i>

426
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,520
<i>I really can't handle him by myself.</i>

427
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,400
<i>You have to come and save me.</i>

428
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,840
<i>Mrs. Guan's stewed meat is incredible.</i>

429
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,760
<i>Come and try it.</i>

430
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,440
<i>No.</i>

431
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,720
<i>I woke up with a stuffy nose this morning.</i>

432
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,160
<i>The heater is not working</i>

433
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,960
<i>and even the hot water bottle broke.</i>

434
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,240
<i>I can only wrap myself</i>

435
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,520
<i>in a blanket and shiver.</i>

436
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,680
{\an8}<i>Get me my nunchucks!</i>

437
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,320
{\an8}<i>Get me my nunchucks!</i>

438
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,160
<i>Open the door.</i>

439
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,240
What on earth?

440
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,200
Even Rangrang has learned to play pranks.

441
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,720
999 GANMAOLING COLD REMEDY GRANULES

442
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,840
Hello, Rangrang.

443
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,160
<i>I was going to Guan Fang's home</i>

444
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,520
<i>to bring medicine to Gu Ran.</i>

445
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,440
<i>I bought too much,</i>

446
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,920
<i>so I brought you some on the way.</i>

447
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,240
But Guan Fang's home and mine

448
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,560
are in the opposite direction.

449
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,080
Rangrang, does "on the way"

450
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,040
mean following your own desires?

451
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,400
<i>Your house is on the way</i>

452
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
<i>from the pharmacy.</i>

453
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,000
<i>So...</i>

454
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,560
You don't have to explain. I get it.

455
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,240
Rangrang, I like that

456
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,640
you don't say what you mean.

457
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,400
<i>Over there.</i>

458
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,480
<i>One, two.</i>

459
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,160
Do you think Zhang Lurang will come?

460
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,960
He hasn't replied.

461
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,920
I know him. He will come.

462
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,040
Do you want to bet on it?

463
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,240
Sure.

464
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,440
I don't believe he will.

465
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,880
It's almost time.

466
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,120
What do you mean?

467
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,240
Three, two, one.

468
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,320
Who is it?

469
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,240
No way.

470
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,320
I told you.

471
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,760
Lurang just doesn't talk much.

472
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,120
But he's actually lovable.

473
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,600
Take your medicine.

474
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,120
Lurang,

475
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,640
did you buy it just for me?

476
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,760
It's to treat your brain.

477
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,680
I'm not leaving.

478
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,760
So can you let go of me now?

479
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,480
{\an8}To be honest,

480
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,440
{\an8}I've never slept

481
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,800
{\an8}with anyone else since I was five.

482
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,360
I slept with my back against the wall

483
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,840
whenever I felt scared.

484
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,080
I've never felt so secure.

485
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,720
Also,

486
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,800
the hot water bottle you bought for me
is very warm.

487
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,920
I'm quite enjoying being a patient.

488
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,320
Don't get the wrong idea.

489
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,920
I bought an extra one by accident.

490
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,280
You're not worried about getting a cold,

491
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,600
but I don't want to be infected.

492
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,920
Cover yourselves properly.

493
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,600
Smarty-pants like you two

494
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,800
are only good at studying

495
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,400
and can't look after yourselves.

496
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,960
{\an8}You're not any better.

497
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,880
{\an8}Did your fairy godmother
pull up your blanket

498
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,400
{\an8}when you were uncovered last night?

499
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,640
I'm as fit as a fiddle.

500
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,280
I don't get cold easily.

501
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,800
Are you saying I'm weaker than you?

502
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,840
Come on. Let's compare.

503
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
Bring it on.

504
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,840
Mine is better. See?

505
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
I have to take this call.

506
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,360
We'll compare next time.

507
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,400
Hello, Mom.

508
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,640
<i>Were you sleeping, Ranran?</i>

509
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,400
Not yet.

510
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,440
<i>I have good news.</i>

511
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,000
<i>The flu in Huiyuan is under control.</i>

512
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,400
<i>Your dad hasn't rested much</i>

513
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,920
<i>this whole week.</i>

514
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,560
<i>We received so many pennants</i>

515
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,120
<i>from the patients' families.</i>

516
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,840
<i>At first, the director wanted us
to stay for a few more days.</i>

517
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,360
<i>But your dad was worried
about you being alone at home,</i>

518
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,920
<i>so he insisted on hurrying back.</i>

519
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,360
<i>Why are you talking about that?</i>

520
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,960
<i>Why not?</i>

521
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,480
No need to worry about me.

522
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,880
I'm staying at my friend's house.

523
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,480
His grandma's cooking is exquisite.

524
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,800
I think I've gained weight.

525
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,720
<i>That's great.</i>

526
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,120
<i>When I get home,
I'll make you something delicious.</i>

527
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,640
I want to eat dumplings.

528
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,800
<i>Sure.</i>

529
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
<i>I'll get your dad to make them.</i>

530
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,640
<i>He makes great dumplings.</i>

531
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,960
You two stay safe out there too.

532
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,720
I hope to see you soon.

533
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,320
<i>Okay. Don't worry.</i>

534
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,240
<i>You should sleep early.</i>

535
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,560
<i>You have school tomorrow.</i>

536
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,240
Bye.

537
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,800
Do you want to get another fever?

538
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,480
It feels as if the world

539
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,040
always needs heroes.

540
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,440
But

541
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,080
I don't suppose anyone wishes

542
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,000
for their own family members
to be the heroes.

543
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,520
Special treatment for the heroes' child.

544
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,320
You can make use of it tonight.

545
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,080
How is giving me a Walkman
considered special treatment?

546
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,720
Is Guan Fang snoring again?

547
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,920
Let's go.

548
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,040
GUAN FANG

549
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,520
<i>Can you guys really sleep like that?</i>

550
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,800
<i>You won't understand brotherhood.</i>

551
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,719
<i>We don't mind one another.</i>

552
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,239
Gu Ran!

553
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,719
You roll around too much.

554
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,520
-Stop talking.
-Don't steal my blanket.

555
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,360
Stop it. It's mine.

556
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,480
This is the first time

557
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,960
that I've found being sick
to be an enjoyable thing.

558
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,040
<i>A hot water bottle from Rangrang.</i>

559
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,400
<i>Medicine from Rangrang.</i>

560
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,440
<i>The bag that Rangrang used.</i>

561
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,880
<i>And...</i>

562
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,720
<i>Zaizai, whom Rangrang cares about.</i>

563
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,680
Rangrang, are you having trouble sleeping

564
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,120
because you're worried about me?

565
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,680
<i>Have you taken the medicine?</i>

566
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,120
Yes.

567
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,600
The hot water bottle is very warm.

568
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,520
<i>Then</i>

569
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,560
<i>sleep early.</i>

570
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,480
I'm already in bed.

571
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,440
What about you?

572
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,720
I'm about to sleep too.

573
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,160
<i>Although I have a stuffy nose,</i>

574
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,640
<i>my hearing seems
to have become more sensitive.</i>

575
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,440
<i>With his voice
transmitted into my ears so clearly,</i>

576
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,560
<i>nothing seems to scare me now.</i>
