<i>Three, two, one!</i>

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,040
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,080
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,760
<i>From Now On,
Someone Will Share Your Happiness.</i>

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
<i>Don't forget the gathering
we mentioned before.</i>

7
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,960
<i>See you guys
at Jifeng Restaurant at 7 p.m.</i>

8
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,960
My department has a gathering tonight.

9
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,680
I won't be going with you guys.

10
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,320
I suddenly remembered something.

11
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,880
Xie Linnan is the president
of your department, right?

12
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,200
Yes. Why?

13
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Didn't you post
on your Moments a few days ago

14
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,760
that you had a sore throat?

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,120
I saw him on my way to class.

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
He gave me some medicine to give to you.

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,320
Wasn't the medicine on the desk yours?

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,000
No.

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,400
I forgot to tell you about it.

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,280
I just remembered when he was brought up.

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,720
Your department's president
is so nice to members.

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,160
That's quite rare.

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,040
<i>-Cheers!
-Cheers!</i>

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,600
Welcome, everyone!

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,520
Welcome!

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,639
Welcome to the new members

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,440
who have joined the New Media Department!

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,240
From now on, we are one big family.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,280
Welcome!

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,680
We were supposed
to have this gathering long ago,

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,320
but I didn't expect us to be so busy.

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
But luckily, we have good news.

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,440
The promotional video
we made for the school

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,080
has already been shared over 10,000 times.

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,320
Not only that,

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,360
the school leaders even praised us.

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,800
I think our budget for next semester
will be very generous.

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,840
You can all drink, right?

39
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,240
This will make things more lively.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
Here, I'll pour a glass for you, Zaizai.

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,160
Here you go. Yours.

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,080
Where is mine?

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,200
Seniors can wait.

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,440
Let the junior drink first.

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,720
It's better for girls not to drink.

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,280
There are other drinks here.

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,840
Just eating and drinking is boring.

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,240
-How about we play a game?
-Drink this instead.

49
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,400
How about truth or dare?

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,560
-Okay.
-Why not?

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,600
What are the rules?

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,040
-Hold on.
-Here.

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,240
-Make some room.
-Okay.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,040
The tip of the pen shall pick the player.

55
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,480
-Pick one.
-Pick one.

56
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,320
-Pick one.
-Come on!

57
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,360
-Pick one!
-Truth.

58
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
Truth?

59
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,680
Then let's have the freshmen
ask the question.

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
I'm sure you're curious
about our president.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,760
Is there a girl you like?

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,680
What is your type?

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,840
Do you have any?

64
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,080
Well...

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,200
Yes.

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,800
Yes?

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,040
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,400
I don't know if I have a chance.

69
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,360
-A chance?
-Who is it?

70
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,720
-Is she in our department?
-Which college is she in?

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,080
Only one question. Let's move on.

72
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,760
-It's okay.
-I won't be so unlucky.

73
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,160
-Fine.
-We'll get you next time.

74
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,760
<i>Rangrang, I'm done.</i>

75
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,160
<i>Come and get your girlfriend.</i>

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,959
I'm going out for a bit.

77
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
Is he going out to pick up takeout?

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Have you ever seen anyone

79
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,920
dressed in advance to pick up takeout?

80
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,240
Linnan, we'll get going then.

81
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,320
Be careful. Text us when you arrive.

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,520
-Bye.
-Bye, guys.

83
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,880
I'll walk you back.

84
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,840
It's okay.

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,680
My boyfriend is coming to get me soon.

86
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,560
I see.

87
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,840
It's already late.

88
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,040
I'll go after your boyfriend gets here.

89
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,120
Okay.

90
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,960
Is your boyfriend the one

91
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,480
who helped you answer the roll call?

92
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,440
Yes.

93
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,280
When school started,
I remember you asked me

94
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,640
where the College of Engineering dorm was.

95
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,160
I guess you were looking for him.

96
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,680
I can tell you really like him.

97
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,120
He is the person
I fell in love with at first sight

98
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
and he is the best person in the world.

99
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,560
Hearing your high praise for him,

100
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,720
I suddenly feel
there is nothing to regret.

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Su Zaizai.

102
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,240
Rangrang.

103
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,440
Go on. I'm leaving too.

104
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,360
Bye.

105
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,360
Bye, Linnan.

106
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,680
Bye.

107
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,520
What were you two talking about?

108
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,880
We were talking

109
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,080
about my boyfriend.

110
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,600
I told our president

111
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,120
that my boyfriend
is the best person in the world.

112
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,360
I like him the most.

113
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,760
So? Are you happy?

114
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,200
Rangrang, you're quiet again.

115
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,040
Look, you're such a dull person.

116
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,560
Yet I've let you stay in my heart

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,720
for so many years.

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,840
I'm truly the most generous landlady.

119
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,040
What are you doing?

120
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
Paying my rent.

121
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,160
Then you owe me a lot of rent.

122
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,680
Then I'll pay you slowly.

123
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,880
But I'll need to charge you interest.

124
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,000
<i>That's about it for the weekly meeting.</i>

125
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
There is nothing else to discuss.

126
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,600
That's right.

127
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
I nearly forgot.

128
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,040
New Year's Day is coming soon.

129
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,680
The school is planning

130
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,120
a New Year's Eve party.

131
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,240
Usually, the Literary Department

132
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,040
is responsible for such events.

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,640
But they have fewer members this year.

134
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,440
So our department
will be contributing too.

135
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Zhu Miao.

136
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,800
I remember
from your interview for our department

137
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
that you've organized many programs

138
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,000
in high school, right?

139
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,480
How about we leave this task to you?

140
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
Will that be okay?

141
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,200
Don't put me in a difficult spot.

142
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,800
I only took part
in a few dance competitions

143
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,720
in high school.

144
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,880
It was nothing substantial.

145
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
How is that not substantial?

146
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,320
Stop being modest.

147
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm really not confident.

148
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,480
When I was searching

149
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,160
for content materials online,

150
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,880
I remember seeing a video of Zhang Lurang

151
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,480
in a high school drama performance.

152
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,120
Does that count as experience

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,480
in organizing programs?

154
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,800
How about you let Zhang Lurang help me?

155
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,679
Okay, you two can work together.

156
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,640
Zhang Lurang, is that all right?

157
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
Okay.

158
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,080
Zhang Lurang.

159
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,400
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

160
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,240
It's okay.

161
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,440
We're in the same department.

162
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,760
Why don't I buy you lunch today?

163
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,520
Afterward, we can find an empty classroom

164
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,880
and gather reference materials.

165
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,080
I'll pass on lunch.

166
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,440
Let me know
if you need specific materials.

167
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,480
I can search in advance.

168
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,920
If we need to discuss face-to-face,

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,240
we can schedule another time.

170
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,160
I'll get going now.

171
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,880
Zaizai,

172
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,120
you've been spending a lot of time
in the dorm lately.

173
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Where is your boyfriend?

174
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,560
His department assigned him a task.

175
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,480
He has been busy

176
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,400
with his college's New Year's event.

177
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,520
I'll ask him if he's free.

178
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
<i>Ding!</i>

179
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,480
<i>Your gentle, lovely,
and understanding girlfriend</i>

180
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,200
<i>is asking you if you want</i>

181
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,640
<i>to have dinner with her tonight.</i>

182
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,360
<i>Please reply upon receiving this message.</i>

183
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,640
<i>Copy that.</i>

184
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,840
<i>I'll come and find you later.</i>

185
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,160
Once the program is finalized,

186
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,800
we can arrange rehearsals
based on everyone's availability, okay?

187
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,160
Okay.

188
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,480
Since it's late, that's all for today.

189
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,360
Zhang Lurang,

190
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,680
I'm a bit undecided

191
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,440
about the format of the program.

192
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,640
I want to hear your opinion.

193
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,680
Can I take up some of your time?

194
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,640
Yes, both of you should discuss it.

195
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,160
Let me know
once the program is confirmed. Okay?

196
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
-Okay.
-Okay.

197
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,320
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Bye.

198
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,320
Bye.

199
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,240
Okay, take a look at these options.

200
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,160
If we choose this dance,

201
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,760
it requires a higher level of skill.

202
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,040
What do you think

203
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,840
about a recitation of poetry?

204
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,600
The Publicity Department
is already doing that.

205
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,560
We can't do that then.

206
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,560
How about a choir performance?

207
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,520
A choir performance is less challenging

208
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,040
and has a higher possibility.

209
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,240
Why don't we go with that?

210
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,800
-Okay.
-Great.

211
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,640
Let me see.

212
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,600
What song should we pick

213
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,960
for the choir performance?

214
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,800
Should we do a mashup or...

215
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,280
I'm really sorry.

216
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,240
I lost track of time.

217
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,920
I think your girlfriend

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,160
must be getting impatient.

219
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
It's okay. You can come in.

220
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,480
You're not disturbing us.

221
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,560
Well, I'm sorry

222
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,680
for taking up your boyfriend lately.

223
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,080
After the program is over,

224
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,360
I'll treat you guys to a meal.

225
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,400
It's okay.

226
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,520
I won't be in your way then.

227
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
I'll get going.

228
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,800
Bye.

229
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,160
Let's go.

230
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,960
What do you want to eat?

231
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,880
Grilled fish.

232
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
<i>It's over.</i>

233
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,320
<i>If I didn't have class,
I would come and see it.</i>

234
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,840
Goodness.

235
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,680
What is this?

236
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,760
No way.

237
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,400
What is it?

238
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,880
It's nothing.

239
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,800
Let us look into it first.

240
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,360
We'll tell you later.

241
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,640
Don't ask us yet.

242
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,000
Does it have to do with me?

243
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,480
No!

244
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,600
Zaizai, we'll tell you tonight, okay?

245
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,080
Okay.

246
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,920
What is this?

247
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,840
I follow a lot of our schoolmates
on Weibo.

248
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know

249
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,840
when I started following Zhu Miao.

250
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,360
I just happened to check my Weibo today.

251
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,720
Then I saw her post this picture.

252
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,200
Zaizai, did you know about this?

253
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,080
No, I didn't know.

254
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,520
But this photo is different

255
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,040
from the original photo that I saw.

256
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,400
See? I knew it.

257
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,280
Zhang Lurang doesn't look like a cheater.

258
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,800
Why would Zhu Miao do this?

259
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
But this can easily mislead others.

260
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,640
What is her Weibo username?

261
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
-Let me check.
-I'll send it to you.

262
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,160
ZHU MIAO

263
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,880
<i>When I'm with someone interesting,</i>

264
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,640
<i>I'm happy no matter what I'm doing.</i>

265
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,120
<i>Gosh. Is this your boyfriend?</i>

266
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,280
<i>He's very good-looking.</i>

267
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,360
WE'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE CLOSER

268
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,000
Zaizai.

269
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,440
Check your phone.

270
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,600
ZHU MIAO: THE SUNLIGHT
SEEMS MUCH DIMMER AT THIS MOMENT

271
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,520
HE'S SO ADORABLE
WHEN HE'S SPACING OUT!

272
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,560
She's getting more outrageous.

273
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Does she have some kind of delusion?

274
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,280
She made it up quite convincingly.

275
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,560
I know, right?

276
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,720
If I didn't know you,

277
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,200
even I would believe it.

278
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,360
Su Zaizai, you need to stay calm.

279
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,280
Patience.

280
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,320
No, I can't be patient.

281
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,720
I have to confront her about this.

282
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,560
She made another post.

283
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,720
Look. Is that her?

284
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,600
Hi.

285
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,840
It's you.

286
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,320
What's the matter?

287
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,560
Something has been bothering me lately.

288
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,800
I'm deeply perplexed.

289
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,400
If you don't mind,

290
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,240
can you tell me about it?

291
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,360
Well, I saw a girl on Weibo

292
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,160
who keeps posting photos of my boyfriend

293
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,040
with very misleading captions.

294
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,560
Many people think they are a couple.

295
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,520
But she never clears the air.

296
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,080
Anyway, I don't think it's right.

297
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,360
What do you think?

298
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,920
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,240
I usually like
to casually document my life.

300
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,360
But I didn't expect you to misunderstand.

301
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,640
As for this matter,

302
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,160
I don't want to tell Zhang Lurang

303
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,600
and bother him with it.

304
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,120
So please delete all your Weibo posts

305
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,720
related to him.

306
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
If my boyfriend appears

307
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,760
in someone else's Weibo posts
for no reason,

308
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,280
I wouldn't be happy about it, right?

309
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,080
I understand. Don't worry.
I'll delete them.

310
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,720
Why isn't Zhu Miao here yet?

311
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,360
It's weird.

312
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,560
She's usually punctual for the meetings.

313
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,720
Sorry, everyone. I'm late.

314
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,840
What's wrong?

315
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,520
Why are your eyes red?

316
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,480
Were you crying?

317
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
It's a personal matter.

318
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,119
I don't want to trouble everyone.

319
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,040
Don't worry.

320
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,880
You're too nice,
so others take advantage of you.

321
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,800
Tell us.

322
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,119
We might be able to help you.

323
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,359
-Yes, tell us.
-That's right.

324
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes, we're all friends.

325
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,000
He's right.

326
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,960
I'm really fine.

327
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,240
Let's start the meeting.

328
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,840
Are you Zhang Lurang?

329
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,560
I'm Zhu Miao's roommate.

330
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,480
I'm here to ask you something.

331
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,040
Do you know what your girlfriend did?

332
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,000
What's wrong
with Miaomiao posting pictures

333
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,120
on her Weibo account?

334
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,880
Why is your girlfriend upset?

335
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,880
She even made Miaomiao
delete the pictures.

336
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
What a bully!

337
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,680
Miaomiao cried silently under her blanket

338
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,360
even when she felt wronged.

339
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,600
She only told us after we hounded her.

340
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,800
So did she delete them?

341
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,760
Did she delete the photos
that my girlfriend doesn't like?

342
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,480
Hold on.

343
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,920
If you don't know,

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,080
I'll ask her myself.

345
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,800
What kind of attitude is this?

346
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,600
What the heck?

347
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,560
What's wrong?

348
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,040
Someone in the Organization Department

349
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,320
posted about the love-hate relationship

350
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,120
between a beauty and a hunk

351
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,360
in the College of Engineering.

352
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,680
Zaizai, is Zhang Lurang
in the Organization Department?

353
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,080
It also says

354
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,040
that Zhu Miao cried
during yesterday's department meeting

355
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,560
while looking at Zhang Lurang.

356
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,080
It was clear what was going on.

357
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,160
I'm going to reply

358
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
and ask what is so clear.

359
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,720
They're spouting nonsense.

360
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,840
I suppose I have to use my last resort.

361
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,960
Give me the dorm key.

362
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,280
I need to head back first.

363
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,720
{\an8}Why are you going back to the dorm?

364
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,920
I have to get changed.

365
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,640
Zhang Lurang,

366
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,760
did my roommate say something
to you just now?

367
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,960
Don't misunderstand.

368
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,400
It's not what you think.

369
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,280
It has nothing to do with Zaizai.

370
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,240
I didn't

371
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,920
consider your girlfriend's feelings

372
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,560
when I posted the pictures.

373
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,560
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,480
Rangrang!

375
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,360
What a coincidence.

376
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,320
I was just explaining the photos

377
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,840
to Zhang Lurang.

378
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,760
Zaizai, I didn't expect you

379
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,760
to mind so much.

380
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,800
If any conflicts arise

381
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,680
between you two because of me,

382
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,560
I'll feel really guilty.

383
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,920
It's okay.

384
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,120
I'll explain it to my boyfriend myself.

385
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,520
Are you going to the cafeteria too?

386
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,480
Why don't we go together?

387
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Sure. Let's go.

388
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,000
My leg.

389
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,120
It hurts!

390
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,240
Does it still hurt?

391
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,280
I'm so clumsy

392
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,200
that I sprain my foot just by walking.

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,480
I just remembered

394
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,120
that I still have something to do.

395
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,280
I'll get going first.

396
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,520
Zhu Miao, aren't you going to eat?

397
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,760
Maybe next time.

398
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
Let's eat together next time.

399
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,160
Bye!

400
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,440
Zhang Lurang,

401
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,880
can I ask you something?

402
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,800
Why are you smiling so happily?

403
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,880
It's because

404
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,640
my girlfriend is so adorable.

405
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,560
You should wear a mask when you go out.

406
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,320
Being so handsome is quite troublesome.

407
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,080
ZHANG LURANG

408
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,320
That's more like it.

409
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,680
<i>You haven't posted in so long.</i>

410
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,800
<i>Is that your girlfriend?</i>

411
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,120
<i>Yes, my girlfriend.</i>

412
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,560
RANGRANG

413
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,360
<i>Rangrang, did you change
your display photo?</i>

414
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,160
<i>Yes.</i>

415
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,240
<i>Won't Susu get jealous</i>

416
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,560
<i>since you removed her photo?</i>

417
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,440
<i>I've discussed this with her.</i>

418
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,320
<i>What did you say?</i>

419
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,120
<i>Susu said</i>

420
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,960
<i>it's better if it's the other Susu.</i>

421
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,320
<i>She thinks she can accept it.</i>

422
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,240
<i>When I go home for winter break,</i>

423
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
<i>I'll buy extra jerky to treat her.</i>

424
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,960
That's hilarious.

425
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,320
What is so funny?

426
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,560
Didn't Zhu Miao
delete all of Zhang Lurang's photos

427
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,960
from her Weibo earlier?

428
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,880
Now she's starting to post again

429
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,120
and they are all pictures

430
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,920
featuring our Student Union's president.

431
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,080
Even the captions are the same as before.

432
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,640
Does that mean she has changed her target?

433
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,560
Probably.

434
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,600
Anyway, it has nothing to do with me.

435
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,480
I'm just looking forward to going home
for the New Year.

436
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,400
Zaizai,

437
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,920
are you also going home today?

438
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Alone?

439
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,840
Obviously not.

440
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,720
Why would she be alone?

441
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,840
<i>We're on winter break now.</i>

442
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,160
<i>It's the first time we've been away
from home for so long.</i>

443
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,280
<i>Now that we're going home,</i>

444
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,600
<i>I realize how much I miss Jiangyi,</i>

445
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,120
<i>Mr. Su Jianhua, and Ms. Zhou Xiaoli.</i>

446
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,920
<i>It feels really great</i>

447
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,840
<i>to go back with Rangrang.</i>

448
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,200
Having him around

449
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,840
makes me feel safe wherever I am.

450
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,840
The journey is a bit long.

451
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,840
Leaning on this will be more comfortable.

452
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,840
Here.

453
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,200
If you get tired, you can lean on me.

454
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,040
Okay.

455
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,840
We're leaving now.

456
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
Slow down.

457
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,240
Rangrang, we're finally back in Jiangyi.

458
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,000
Even though it has only been half a year,

459
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,760
everything feels different.

460
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,480
Maybe the air is better

461
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,680
or maybe the roads have become wider.

462
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
Even the winter doesn't feel cold anymore.

463
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,720
We're here so soon.

464
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,640
I told you earlier to slow down.

465
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
This won't do.

466
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,840
I should tell my parents about us.

467
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,840
Or else, I can't even invite you in.

468
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,840
I told my uncle

469
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,440
on the phone yesterday.

470
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,680
Does Mr. Lin already know?

471
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,040
This is bad.

472
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,320
He must think I have stolen you away.

473
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,440
I shouldn't have slept so much

474
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,880
during his math classes

475
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,800
so he would have
a better impression of me.

476
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,440
Don't worry.

477
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
My uncle has always had
a good impression of you.

478
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,480
Really?

479
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,280
{\an8}When you get home,
talk nicely to your child.

480
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,440
{\an8}Don't start quarreling again
because you disagree.

481
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,360
{\an8}All right. That's all then.

482
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,280
{\an8}I'm hanging up now.

483
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,240
Honey,

484
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,840
do you remember my coworker
who went on a business trip with me?

485
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,720
I think so. What's up?

486
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,840
His son is already in Grade 12.

487
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,560
They argue every day at home.

488
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
But his kid refuses
to tell him what is wrong.

489
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,840
Just today,

490
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,120
the homeroom teacher gave them a call.

491
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,440
Only then did he find out

492
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,360
that his kid
has been skipping school every day

493
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,080
to go out to play games.

494
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,560
How could he not be livid?

495
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,200
No wonder he said he envies me.

496
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,840
Having a daughter is truly heaven.

497
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,240
Especially our daughter, Zaizai.

498
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
She's obedient and sensible.

499
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,080
She has never made me worry at all.

500
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,000
Indeed.

501
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,840
I'm not trying to brag here.

502
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,240
Ever since Zaizai was a child,

503
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,880
she has never hidden anything from me.

504
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,800
What did she write
in her elementary school essays?

505
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,640
"My best friend is my dad."

506
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,400
Stop kidding me.

507
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,280
She's obviously closer to me.

508
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,680
So explain this to me.

509
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,200
Whenever I went on a business trip,

510
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,640
she would call me over ten times a day.

511
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,040
Zaizai is coming home today.
She has probably arrived.

512
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,440
Why are you still standing here?

513
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,680
That's why I bought fish.

514
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,920
I'll make fish soup. Let's go.

515
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,320
So are you going home now?

516
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,080
Head inside first.

517
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,480
What is it?

518
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,200
It's nothing.

519
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,840
Then I'll go inside.

520
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,960
Good heavens, look at them.

521
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,720
It's normal for young people to date.

522
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,160
Don't make a fuss about it.

523
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,040
That scared me.

524
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,960
{\an8}Those look just like Zaizai's clothes.

525
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,720
I almost mistook her for Zaizai.

526
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,920
Su Zaizai!

527
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,720
Don't move.

528
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,240
It's my parents.

529
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,120
How about this?

530
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,680
When I count to three,

531
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,480
you run forward and don't turn back.

532
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
Am I that embarrassing?

533
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
You're right.

534
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,440
We're adults now.

535
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,760
Neither of you move!

536
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,680
I want to see who has the nerve

537
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,520
to pick on my daughter!

538
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,840
Su Zaizai, aren't you so daring now?

539
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,360
Why didn't you tell us you're dating?

540
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,800
Do you know
what kind of boy you're dating? You...

541
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,280
Xiaozhang?

542
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,960
Mr. and Mrs. Su.

543
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,160
-We meet again.
-Yes.

544
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,440
Zaizai,

545
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,320
I need to seriously criticize you.

546
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,920
Why didn't you tell us you're dating?

547
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,480
Have you not considered

548
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,880
that he might be cold outside?

549
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,880
Get Xiaozhang inside

550
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,200
so he can warm up.

551
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
That's right.

552
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,160
-Have you not had dinner yet?
-Dad.

553
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,520
-You must eat.
-Dad!

554
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,280
Next time, just come straight inside.

555
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,960
Xiaozhang,

556
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,880
how long have you two

557
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,880
been dating?

558
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,440
It has been half a year.

559
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,480
Mom, it's too late to tell us

560
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,680
to break up now.

561
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,480
Who made the first step?

562
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,400
Me.

563
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,880
I pursued him.

564
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,040
I knew it.

565
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,440
I knew it was my daughter.

566
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,880
Since you've been dating for so long,

567
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,680
there is nothing more I can say.

568
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,840
But I still have something to tell you.

569
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,120
Please do tell, Mrs. Su.

570
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,520
Mom,

571
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,680
don't scare him.

572
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,240
Our daughter, Zaizai,

573
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,760
can be unreasonable.

574
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,280
If you really can't bear it with her,

575
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,640
be sure to tell me about it.

576
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,200
I'll help you criticize her.

577
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,440
You must never endure it alone.

578
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,480
Also,

579
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,880
she has always been a glutton.

580
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,080
You have to help me

581
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,320
take good care of her.

582
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,000
Sometimes when she's happy,

583
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,280
she will start singing.

584
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,920
But her singing is really...

585
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,120
Even as her mom, I can't stand it.

586
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,920
You have to be patient with her.

587
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,440
She doesn't have any other talents
after all.

588
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,560
She just loves singing.

589
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,520
Mom.

590
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,320
Stop it. I'm still here.

591
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,760
I'm losing face here.

592
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,800
I'm helping you prepare him mentally.

593
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,840
What if you scare him away one day?

594
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,640
Where will you
find someone like him again?

595
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,200
My mom was just kidding.

596
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
I'll run away from home if you keep going.

597
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,720
My wife loves to joke around.

598
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,760
Zaizai isn't like that.

599
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,160
At least,

600
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,920
eating a lot is a blessing.

601
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,880
That's right.

602
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,440
Dad!

603
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,800
Did I say something wrong?

604
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,640
Have some water.

605
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,640
Here.

606
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,640
Go and wash an apple.

607
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,080
Go.

608
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,760
If you're not prepared,

609
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,440
we can come next time.

610
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,720
No.

611
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,560
Whether I can salvage the lazy image

612
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,160
that Mr. Lin has of me

613
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,280
{\an8}depends on today.

614
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,240
{\an8}Let's go.

615
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,360
No, I can't.

616
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,640
I'm still a bit nervous.

617
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,760
{\an8}On closer thought,

618
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,320
{\an8}it's like meeting your parents.

619
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,520
I'm here with you.

620
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,720
It must be cold outside.

621
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,320
Here. Have some water to warm yourself.

622
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,600
Thank you, Uncle.

623
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,320
I mean, thank you, Mr. Lin.

624
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Why are you acting
like a high school student

625
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,080
when you're already in university?

626
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,760
You've already graduated.

627
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,520
I can't use your math papers

628
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
to criticize you anymore.

629
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,040
How is your current homeroom class,

630
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,160
Mr. Lin?

631
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,840
The class I'm currently in charge of

632
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,680
is similar to your class.

633
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,280
It's my worst class ever.

634
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,120
I think your water has gone cold.

635
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,840
I'll add some warm water for you.

636
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,160
Uncle, I'll get you a glass too.

637
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Okay.

638
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,320
Lurang is lucky to have met you.

639
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,840
He was always quiet

640
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,280
and not good at expressing himself.

641
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,560
But he has better insight than anyone else

642
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,440
and is far too sensible for his age.

643
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,840
I felt truly sorry for him back then.

644
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,240
But ever since he met you,

645
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,760
he has really changed a lot.

646
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,480
Su Zaizai,

647
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,880
thank you.

648
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,760
My mom always told me

649
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,240
to find a calm and quiet boyfriend.

650
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,400
So this must be fate.

651
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,600
<i>Why do the same words sound so beautiful</i>

652
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,960
<i>when Rangrang says them?</i>
