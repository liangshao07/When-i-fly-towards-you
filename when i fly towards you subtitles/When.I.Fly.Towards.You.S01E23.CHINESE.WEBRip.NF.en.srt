00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,320
I should have eaten more at lunch.

7
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,480
Hello.

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,440
Can I order food by myself?

9
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,320
Sorry, you have to book a table first.

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,840
Do you have a reservation?

11
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,600
Never mind. Thank you.

12
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,520
Zaizai?

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
Is it over?

14
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,840
No.

15
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,760
Mr. Wei drinks a lot.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,840
I bet it will go on for quite a while.

17
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,760
You must be starving.

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
I brought a few buns for you.

19
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,480
But they have gone cold.

20
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,800
Thank you.

21
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
It's just bad luck

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,000
that this happened to you.

23
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,600
Mr. Chen told me you could go home.

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,880
If Mr. Wei sees you when he comes out

25
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,480
and starts a drunken rant,

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,760
you will be in trouble.

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
I've been outside for a while.

28
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,040
I should get back inside.

29
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,040
Stay safe.

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,320
Okay. Don't worry.

31
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,440
<i>Is it over?</i>

32
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,760
<i>Did everything go well?</i>

33
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Let me guess.

34
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,320
Are you having a celebration party?

36
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,040
What's wrong?

37
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,960
It's nothing.

38
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,160
<i>Did you have dinner?</i>

39
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,440
Dinner was extravagant.

40
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,040
We had roasted duck, brined chicken,

41
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,240
{\an8}candied apple fritters,

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,560
{\an8}and spicy boiled meat slices.

43
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,920
<i>They were all delicious.</i>

44
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,960
If that's the case,

45
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,040
why are you crying?

46
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,320
I saw a bus stop just now

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
called "Jiangyi Road."

48
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,600
I got homesick all of a sudden.

49
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,240
<i>I'll go to you.</i>

50
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
It's late.

51
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,280
Rangrang,

52
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,960
I'll buy a ticket
for the earliest trip home tomorrow.

53
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,160
Rangrang,

54
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,080
I didn't make a mistake, right?

55
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,040
<i>No, you didn't.</i>

56
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,920
It's all right.

57
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,840
I will be all right soon.

58
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,200
My phone is out of battery.

59
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I'll talk to you later.

60
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,480
Rest early.

61
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,480
WHEN YOU ARE LOST,
WHERE YOU STAND IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION

62
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,280
Do you want to get on?

63
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,400
This is the last bus.

64
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,080
If you miss it, you won't get home.

65
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,920
My home isn't around here.

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,320
Go home soon.

67
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,080
How I wish

68
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,440
Doraemon's Anywhere Door actually exists.

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,000
<i>You are in the wrong in this too.</i>

70
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,560
<i>You have been working for so long.</i>

71
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,560
<i>Can't you handle such social gatherings?</i>

72
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,320
<i>Reflect on it.</i>

73
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,960
Why are you here?

74
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,960
I know you have been mistreated.

75
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,800
So I came to bring you home.

76
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,400
Is it good?

77
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,040
Yes.

78
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,120
Rangrang,

79
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,840
you drove for three hours.

80
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,520
Aren't you tired?

81
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,360
I am.

82
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,480
Do you find me

83
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,040
a lot of trouble?

84
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,520
If I didn't go there,

85
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,640
I wouldn't have slept soundly tonight.

86
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,280
Zaizai,

87
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,080
not everything should be weighed

88
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,760
for its worth in the world.

89
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,360
If it's possible,

90
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,559
I would like you to trouble me more often.

91
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,760
What's wrong?

92
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
My mom always says

93
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
that words fall on my deaf ears,

94
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,640
going through one ear and out the other.

95
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,680
If I cover my ears,

96
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
I can keep your words in mind.

97
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,320
Dig in.

98
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,560
Okay.

99
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,960
I haven't cooked in a while.

100
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,880
Is it too salty?

101
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,880
No, it's even a little sweet.

102
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,080
Maybe the cook

103
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
was overloaded with sweetness.

A friend of mine opened a restaurant.

107

It's a new restaurant in town.

108
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,400
He wants me to try it out.

109
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,000
I thought it would be boring to eat alone,

110
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,480
so I wanted to see if you are free.

111

We'll go there another time.

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,960
<i>Sure. You can try it out first.</i>

Hello, Lurang.

119
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,000
Is this the important matter
you mentioned?

120
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,200
For me, eating is a priority in life.

121
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,000
Besides, this is a romantic restaurant

122
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,120
with good online ratings.

123
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,320
It's a romantic restaurant,

124
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,680
but we are here for one thing only.

125
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,200
The food.

126
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,960

Gu Ran?

129
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
Is this the restaurant you mentioned?

130
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,280
-I came with a friend...
-Jiang Jia!

131
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,360
I have things to discuss. I have to go.

132
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,920
Sure. We'll talk another time.

133
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,120
Was there traffic?

134
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,920
This is rare.

135
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,000
Jiang Jia came to a romantic restaurant

136
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,640
with a guy.

137
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,880
They don't look like a couple.

138
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,240
I have no idea.

139
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,800
Are you done? I need the menu.

140
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,800
Why haven't you confessed to Jiang Jia?

141
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,680
Is it that obvious?

142
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
It is very obvious.

143
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,320
Everyone can tell.

144
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,760
Right?

145
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,400
Yes, it's obvious.

146
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,520
I knew it all along.

147
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,640
It's not so easy to tell someone

148
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,920
that you like them.

149
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,680
The type that Jiang Jia likes

150
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,240
is someone like Qianyu.

151
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,960
Kind and thoughtful.

152
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,680
I'm afraid to ask her if she likes me.

153
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm even more afraid
to tell her I like her.

154
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,960
Being her good friend

155
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,600
sounds like a nice excuse.

156
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,800
I can turn my heartfelt words into jokes

157
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,760
and give a gift that I bought on a whim

158
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,560
on the pretense that it was a free sample.

159
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,640
But if the confession fails,

160
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,040
things will get awkward between us.

161
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,560
She might ignore me for good.

162
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,880
I'm afraid to even imagine that.

163
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,280
It's good enough

164
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,560
to be good friends.

165
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,320
At least fights and arguments

166
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,840
won't tear us apart that easily.

167
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,480
So...

168
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,160
It's good that you're not confessing.

169
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,240
I'll confess to Jiang Jia.

170
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
-What?
-What?

171
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,960
That is the right thing to do.

172
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,920
If you never make an impulsive move,

173
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,480
you will always regret it.

174
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,760
Go, do it now.

175
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,880
Hold on.

176
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,360
This...

177
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,960
You need to be properly prepared
before winning a girl's heart.

178
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,720
So I need your advice on this.

179
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I need your experience.

180
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,440
I have no such experience.

181
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,240
You get it.

182
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,080
I've been in a dozen relationships.

183
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,760
But they all failed.
Do you still want my advice?

184
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,440
I knew I couldn't count on you guys.

185
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,360
I must rely on myself.

186
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,160
What is your plan?

187
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,520
<i>Jiang Jia loves hot pot,</i>

188
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,440

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,400
and ice cream.

190
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,320
These are foolproof topics.

191
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,640
Gu Ran?

192
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,000
{\an8}Did you just happen

193
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,000
{\an8}to come here after a walk again?

194
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,760
Yes.

195
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,160
Did you just have dinner?

196
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,640
What did you have?

197
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,680
Dumplings.

198
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,920
Dumplings?

199
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,280
Freshly made or frozen?

200
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,200
Freshly made.

201
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
Freshly made.

202
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,240
Good. That is good.

203
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,320
Good.

204
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,400
Well, don't stay up too late.

205
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,360
I should get going.

206
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,240
Gu Ran.

207
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,680
Are you...

208
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,640
It's nothing. I'm heading inside.

209
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,480
Good night.

210
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,400
<i>I think</i>

211
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,320
my effort wasn't entirely fruitless.

212
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,560
She said good night to me.

213
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,000
She said good night!

214
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,040
Don't you think that is a hint?

215
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Not at all.

216
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,960
It's your wishful thinking.

217
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,120
Fine.

218
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,000
Have you read the messages
in the high school group chat?

219
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,000
Those from Year One and Year Two
are throwing an alumni gathering.

220
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,000
It's this weekend.

221
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,040
Are you guys going?

222
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,400
My project is wrapping up.

223
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,080
I'll be a bit busy.

224
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,040
Zaizai might be working overtime.

225
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,280
We'll pass this time.

226
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
I'm not going either.

227
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,480
I'm grabbing drinks with friends.

228
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,800
But I think Zaizai said

229
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,200
Jiang Jia would be there.

230
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,200
Hello? I won't be there this weekend.

231
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,800
Yes, I quit drinking.

232
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,560
Are you free?

233
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,280
Pick an outfit for me.

234
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,720
Am I seeing this right?

235
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,640
It's Gu Ran.

236
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,640
I ran into him
in the hospital not long ago.

237
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,640
He looks the same
as he did back in high school.

238
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,680
I wish I could talk to him.

239
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,160
But he has been frowning at his phone.

240
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,920
It must be something important.

241
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,800
My right side looks better.

242
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,440
They will come in from the front door

243
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,240
and see my perfect side profile.

244
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,440
They will be stunned by my good looks.

245
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,640
What are you staring at?

246
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,040
You look different tonight.

247
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,520
Do I look good?

248
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,160
I bought this dress this afternoon.

249
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
But then again,

250
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,360
I've never tried this style.

251
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,960
Does it look strange?

252
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,960
Not at all.

253
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,560
You look great.

254
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
Should we...

255
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,720
Jiang Jia.

256
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,200
May I have a dance with you?

257
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I can't really dance.

258
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,960
Yes, she doesn't dance well.

259
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,360
It's all right. I can show you the steps.

260
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,160
I'm a slow learner.

261
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,080
Slower than anyone you know.

262
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,600
Give it a try.

263
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,000
-She...
-Okay.

264
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,560
Buddy,

265
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,760
do you know Jiang Jia well?

266
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,400
What is it?

267
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,400
My friend, Sun Yuan,

268
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,040
has liked Jiang Jia for over half a year

269
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,200
and works at the same television station.

270
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,760
He recently decided
to take the initiative.

271
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,840
As his friend, I came to ask you

272
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,800
{\an8}about Jiang Jia's hobbies and interests.

273
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,920
{\an8}You must know.

274
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,680
You know her so well.

275
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,480
Do your old schoolmate a favor.

276
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
I think

277
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,320
I may not know her very well.

278
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,720
<i>Gu Ran?</i>

279
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,720
Did Jiang Jia leave?

280
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,480
Why didn't you leave with her?

281
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,440
What kind of boyfriend are you?

282
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,320
What?

283
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,440
Aren't you two together?

284
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,400
No.

285
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,360
That can't be right.

286
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,200
Jiang Jia has liked you for ages.

287
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,800
Hasn't she confessed?

288
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,800
Hold on.

289
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,760
What do you mean by she likes me?

290
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,400
When we went to that summer market

291
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
after the NCEE ended,

292
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,720
she said...

293
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,080
I won't date a close friend either.

294
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
I think it's not easy being friends.

295
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,120
What if something happens

296
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,240
after we start dating?

297
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,680
It'll be awkward
if we can't be friends anymore.

298
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,680
You are right.

299
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,800
But if it's Gu Ran,

300
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,480
that would be nice.

301
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,240
You have a crush on Gu Ran.

302
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
No, not at all.

303
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,720
You heard it wrong.

304
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,560
That's why she headed straight for you

305
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,160
when she arrived today.

306
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,160
I thought you two were seeing each other.

307
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,840
How could I be wrong?

308
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,840
Thank you!

309
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,640
I just got off a conference call.

310
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,640
What's up?

311
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,920
The night before we watched
the sunrise together,

312
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,760
I didn't finish what I said.

313
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,600
After I left the country,

314
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,120
I wrote it on paper.

315
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,760
I wanted to give it to you
countless times.

316
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,800
When the weather was nice,

317
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,960
when it was raining,

318
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,160
and when I looked up at the stars.

319
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,120
Time and time again,

320
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,240
I failed to give it to you.

321
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,240
I've kept this love letter for five years.

322
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,240
Now,

323
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,240
can I read it out loud to you?

324
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,920
"Jiang Jia,

325
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,200
I've wanted
to tell you this for a long time.

326
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,720
I like you.

327
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,680
I like you a lot.

328
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,480
When I wrote these words down,

329
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,400
I couldn't help but smile.

330
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,240
{\an8}<i>My roommate told me</i>

331
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,560
<i>I was hopeless.</i>

332
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,880
{\an8}<i>I didn't tell him</i>

333
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,920
{\an8}<i>that I didn't want to be cured.</i>

334
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
During my first semester abroad,

335
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,600
I audited a Chinese elective class

336
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,840
in my free time.

337
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,560
<i>The professor taught us some proverbs.</i>

338
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,560
<i>The hardest of them all</i>

339
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,600
<i>is 'knowing oneself.'</i>

340
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,360
I used to say

341
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,240
that if I ever fell in love,

342
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,680
<i>I would show it openly</i>

343
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,960
<i>and let everyone know about it.</i>

344
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,880
<i>Only later did I discover</i>

345
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,120
<i>that I am timid when I like someone</i>

346
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,200
<i>and afraid to let her know.</i>

347
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
I said, 'Jiang Jia is so careless.

348
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,040
Who would fall for her?'

349
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,600
But I secretly kept your discarded photo
in my wallet for five years."

350
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,680
I even said

351
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,680
that it would be nice to be just friends.

352
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,280
But when I saw you dance with another man,

353
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,800
<i>I could only leave out of jealousy.</i>

354
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,640
A friend wouldn't do that.

355
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,920
What would a friend do?

356
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,320
A good friend

357
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,200
won't see you every night

358
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,360
when he closes his eyes.

359
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,960
He wouldn't feel more upset than you
when you are upset.

360
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,720
He wouldn't say so many irrelevant things

361
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,040
just to tell you,

362
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,640
"I like you."

363
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,920
It seems

364
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,840
I didn't take you as a friend either.

365
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,280
A friend wouldn't do that.

366
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,440
Why do I feel like
I dug myself into a hole?

367
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,320
Gu Ran,

368
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,480
you said you would give me
your game console.

369
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,400
Don't forget that.

370
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,600
I have to be happy

371
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,080
even when you guys are not with me.

372
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,080
I can give you the console,

373
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,040
but I won't play with you.

374
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,480
You promised me before.

375
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,160
That was before.

376
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,320
She's in charge of me now.

377
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,480
Who cares about you?

378
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,040
Let's go, Zaizai. Let's ignore them.

379
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,600
How did he confess his love to you?

380
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,200
Tell me in detail.

381
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,200
I'll whisper it to you.

382
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,400
It's about time
for you to get married, right?

383
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,960
I even have your wedding gift money ready.

384
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,200
I've just started dating.

385
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,360
Lurang is first.

386
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,360
Soon.

387
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,080
I'm going to propose to Zaizai.

388
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,200
When?

389
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,560
As soon as I finish my current project.

390
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,520
I would like

391
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,120
to be better prepared.

392
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,520
LUMING TECHNOLOGY, DRONE SEMINAR

393
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,480
Take it easy.

394
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,440
You are the main person
in charge of this drone.

395
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,960
No one knows it better than you.

396
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,360
LUMING TECHNOLOGY, DRONE SEMINAR

397
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,080
<i>Rangrang, I can't leave the office yet.</i>

398
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,480
<i>I don't think I can make it
to the seminar.</i>

399
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
<i>It's okay.</i>

400
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,480
<i>It's just a talk about a new product.</i>

401
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,680
<i>There will be a recording.</i>

402
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,280
<i>You can watch it later.</i>

403
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,880
<i>You don't necessarily have to be here.</i>

404
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,680
<i>But it's your first product.</i>

405
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,360
<i>It's not the last one.</i>

406
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,560
<i>Rangrang, you've got this!</i>

407
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,080
It's about time. Let's go in.

408
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,000
Come on.

409
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,920
Let's go.

410
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
The wide range of applications
of industrial drones

411
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
makes them
unlike consumer and military drones,

412
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,840
which have clear usage scenarios

413
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,840
and functions.

414
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,880
So now, the conflict is the gap

415
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,560
between the users' higher demands

416
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,120
and the product's performance

417
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,680
and service.

418
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,640
Today,

419
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,680
Luming is not just launching a new drone,

420
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,000
but also an all-new system

421
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,880
that can be used in various fields.

422
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,160
The launch of the CW-003

423
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
will open up a whole new world of demand

424
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,840
in the market.

425
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,800
Thank you.

426
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,560
INTELLIGENCE IN AN INSTANT
LUMING TECHNOLOGY, DRONE SEMINAR

427
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,520
All technical questions about drones

428
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,960
have been asked already.

429
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,240
May I ask you a personal question?

430
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Sure.

431
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,120
We all know

432
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,640
that there were many difficulties

433
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,120
in the research process for this drone.

434
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,960
As the youngest
aircraft manufacturing engineer

435
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,560
at Luming,

436
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,560
what are the convictions
that sustained you

437
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,960
to complete this project?

438
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,160
I used to be

439
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,000
a person with no self-confidence.

440
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,960
Even before high school,

441
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,920
I had low self-esteem.

442
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,200
I always thought

443
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,040
I would live out my life in mediocrity.

444
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,480
That was until I met someone.

445
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Every time I look at her,

446
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,080
I see myself in her eyes.

447
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,400
I have always wondered

448
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,760
why someone like her,

449
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,960
who is as bright as the sun, exists.

450
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,400
When I failed,

451
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,840
when I ran into difficulties,

452
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,880
when I wanted to give up,

453
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,400
she would tell me,

454
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
"It's okay.

455
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,040
To me, you are the best."

456
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,600
I don't think
anyone can resist such favoritism.

457
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,560
Not to mention me,

458
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
who has never received
such partiality before.

459
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,720
Because of her unreserved faith in me,

460
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,640
I believe

461
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,440
I should continue to persevere for her.

462
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,280
I have made her cry again.

463
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,760
I'll have to cheer her up when I get home.

464
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
<i>We should all</i>

465
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,000
<i>receive the same amount of love.</i>

466
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,000
<i>We should all receive so much love.</i>
