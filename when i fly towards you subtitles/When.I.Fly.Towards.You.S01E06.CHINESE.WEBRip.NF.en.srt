{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,600
<i>When Susu Meets Susu.</i>

6
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,200
Do you see my name?

7
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,680
Who is ranked first?

8
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,640
What about over here?

9
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,600
Do you see my name?

10
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,560
No, I don't.

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
ZHANG LURANG

12
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,760
Zhang Lurang!

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,160
Do you know you're awesome?

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,080
You scored 101 in English!

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,200
And what does that mean?

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,000
You've gone up by 20 points

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,680
in just two weeks!

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,800
It'll be a breeze

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,960
to get to 110.

20
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,440
It's lower than last time.

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,640
But why are you not surprised

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,840
by your score at all?

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,600
I checked my paper after the exam.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Doesn't that take away the surprise?

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
I am surprised.

26
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,320
Really?

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
You scored well too.

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,880
SU ZAIZAI

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,600
Rangrang,

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,480
I almost passed math.

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,160
This is my highest score in math so far.

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,560
Wait for me after school today.

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,840
I have something for you.

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,640
<i>I've just finished my duty.</i>

35
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,920
<i>You must have gotten on the bus already.</i>

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,040
<i>It's okay.</i>

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
<i>I can give it to you tomorrow.</i>

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,480
<i>I haven't.</i>

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,680
SCHOOL

40
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,680
Rangrang!

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Isn't it a coincidence?

42
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,520
It so happens that the bus is late today,

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,280
so I got here on time.

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,440
This is luck.

45
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,880
I'm so lucky.

46
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,440
Here, your reward.

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,840
What reward?

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,480
Didn't I tell you?

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,480
I would reward you
if you score well this time.

50
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,800
I kept my word.

51
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,400
Thank you.

52
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,760
I think

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
it has other functions.

54
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,280
I didn't check thoroughly.

55
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,680
You can check when you get home.

56
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,560
Can it speak?

57
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,800
I...

58
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,360
I don't know.

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
Why isn't the bus here yet?

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,920
<i>Rangrang, congratulations</i>

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,280
<i>on getting a good score.</i>

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,280
<i>I hope</i>

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,519
<i>you'll continue to study hard
and keep up the good work.</i>

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,360
<i>Ms. Su Zaizai is serious, responsible,</i>

65
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,360
<i>positive, and cute.</i>

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,920
<i>A long-term collaboration with her</i>

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,040
<i>is the way to go.</i>

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,720
<i>Rangrang, congratulations</i>

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,920
<i>on getting a good score.</i>

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,840
<i>I hope</i>

71
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,040
<i>you'll continue to study hard
and keep up the good work.</i>

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,000
<i>Ms. Su Zaizai is serious, responsible,</i>

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,000
<i>positive, and cute.</i>

74
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,480
<i>A long-term collaboration with her</i>

75
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
<i>is the way to go.</i>

76
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,080
The exams were a bit difficult this time.

77
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,600
Take a closer look after you get home,

78
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,080
especially the tricky questions.

79
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,000
That's right.

80
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
One more thing.

81
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Our school's annual autumn sports meet

82
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,160
is about to open for registration.

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
Be proactive, everyone.

84
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,320
Each event needs at least two contestants.

85
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
Wang Nan, get a name list after class.

86
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
-Okay.
-Okay, class is dismissed.

87
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280
I heard a senior say

88
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
that registration every year

89
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,960
is like forceful recruitment.

90
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,560
The class reps are the unluckiest ones.

91
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,920
Not only do people hate them

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,200
for asking others to join,

93
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
but they also have to take on the events

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,080
that nobody signs up for.

95
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,240
Why don't you help me and join an event?

96
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
I'll run the 1,000 m race.

97
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,880
Ditto.

98
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,160
I don't have stamina.

99
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,640
I'll do the long jump.

100
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,680
Great!

101
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,240
Why don't you girls

102
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,680
join one more?

103
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,880
No way.

104
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,080
This isn't some BOGO deal.

105
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm considered nice.

106
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,160
Have you seen the other classes?

107
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,160
Sign-ups are more direct and crude.

108
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,440
How so?

109
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,880
You are to sign up

110
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,560
for whatever lot you draw.

111
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,600
Why not just assign it directly?

112
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,960
Men's 100 m relay. Men's relay.

113
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,920
Men's relay.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,440
Men's relay.

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,360
What did you get?

116
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,200
100 m relay.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,640
What's wrong?

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,640
Ms. Zhang,

119
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,800
I think we should sign up for events
according to their own wishes.

120
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,080
It's unfair to take part in what you draw.

121
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,280
Look at me. My legs are so long.

122
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,680
I'm a better short-distance sprinter.

123
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,280
I drew the shot put.

124
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,400
That's a waste of my talents.

125
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800
That's why I said

126
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,000
you can swap events.

127
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,040
Does anyone want to swap with Gu Ran?

128
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,200
Ms. Zhang, I do!

129
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
What did you draw?

130
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
{\an8}Men's 2,000 m.

131
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,000
Hurry up.

132
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,560
Hurry up.

133
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
I'm okay with the shot put.

134
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,960
Well, Ms. Zhang,

135
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,240
I suddenly feel

136
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,040
that the shot put is fine.

137
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,520
In the previous meets,

138
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,680
everyone would be reluctant

139
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,000
to do long-distance running and shot put.

140
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,000
Drawing lots is to ensure participants

141
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,440
in every event.

142
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,360
There are still over ten days left.

143
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Get ready.

144
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
Class is dismissed.

145
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,680
Am I really going to put a shot?

146
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,840
I'll be lucky
if the shot doesn't put me out.

147
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Let me see.

148
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,520
100 M RELAY

149
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,520
100 M RELAY

150
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,880
"100 m relay."

151
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,240
<i>Rangrang, I will surpass you this time.</i>

152
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,240
<i>I'm running the 1,000 m race.</i>

153
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,120
<i>I'm not bragging.</i>

154
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,080
<i>Whenever my mom
chased me with her slippers,</i>

155
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,200
<i>she could never catch me.</i>

156
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,840
<i>I have the top three in the bag.</i>

157
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,560
<i>If you cheer me on,</i>

158
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,320
<i>I will try my best to get first place.</i>

159
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,680
<i>Don't push yourself</i>

160
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,800
<i>if it's too difficult.</i>

161
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,120
Don't pretend to be reserved.

162
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,920
You obviously want to cheer for me.

163
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,000
Zaizai,

164
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,280
aren't you afraid you'll get a stomachache
from drinking iced water in the morning?

165
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,919
I am hungry.

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,640
Hungry? Great.

167
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,240
Go and buy some Xu's rice noodle rolls.

168
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,559
We're having breakfast soon.

169
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,480
But it's the weekend.

170
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,920
Come on. Get into the mode.

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,040
The sports meet is coming up.

172
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,520
Get into the mode.

173
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,520
Quick, go on.

174
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Besides, your mom has been craving this

175
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,640
for a long time.

176
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,520
So that's the main reason, isn't it?

177
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,320
What? Are you going back to sleep?

178
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm getting changed.

179
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,080
The money is on the coffee table.

180
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,000
Be quick.

181
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,400
Your mom and I go to work at 9 a.m.

182
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,800
How nice.

183
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't have to go myself.

184
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Rangrang?

185
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,280
Can you get up?

186
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,840
It hurts.

187
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,840
That looks serious.

188
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Let's go to the hospital.

189
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,240
You'll have to take me there.

190
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,040
Your golden retriever is a bully.

191
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,200
I'll go with you.

192
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,400
Does your bike still work?
I'll bike you to the hospital.

193
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,840
Is it really okay to leave your dog

194
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,400
in the security room?

195
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,080
It's okay. The security guards know her.

196
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,120
She must be a big deal.

197
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,880
Even the security guards know her.

198
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,600
But does she not like strangers?

199
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,560
Or does she simply hate me?

200
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,960
She doesn't hate you.

201
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,520
But she bit me.

202
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,160
You have to take responsibility.

203
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,120
Sure.

204
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,040
By the way, what is her name?

205
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,520
Susu.

206
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
I am here!

207
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,760
Rangrang, my nickname is Susu.

208
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,160
Since she has the same name as me,

209
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,280
I'll keep a dog named Rangrang.

210
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,800
Then we'll be even.

211
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Does it not hurt anymore?

212
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,120
It still hurts!

213
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,200
Hold on tight then.

214
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,760
It will hurt more

215
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,120
if you fall off.

216
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
Then I'll hold on tightly.

217
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,840
Endure it for a moment.

218
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Let me handle this briefly.

219
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,160
It seems

220
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,480
to be just an external injury.

221
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,840
Your ankle is sprained.

222
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,680
But we must wait for the CT scan result

223
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,320
to see if your bones are injured.

224
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,600
Thank you, doctor.

225
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,040
{\an8}Then let's go outside
and wait for the CT scan result.

226
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,960
Remember. Don't let her move too much.

227
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,960
Okay.

228
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,680
Well, it's just a few steps.

229
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,640
I can manage.

230
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,480
So why were you riding a bike

231
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,440
in the morning?

232
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,400
I was going to buy breakfast.

233
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,960
I wanted
Xu's fresh shrimp rice noodle rolls.

234
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm actually a little hungry.

235
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,640
Okay, I'll buy it for you.

236
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,880
Are you leaving me here alone?

237
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm not hungry anymore.

238
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,920
I mean it.

239
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,080
Okay.

240
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
Then let's wait for the CT scan result.

241
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,280
Lurang?

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,520
Hi, Mr. Gu.

243
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,760
Who is this?

244
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,000
She's my friend.

245
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,040
She hurt her leg
after being frightened by Susu.

246
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,240
Well, this is Gu Ran's dad.

247
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,120
He's a doctor in this hospital.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,240
Hello, Mr. Gu.

249
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,480
My name is Su Zaizai.

250
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm also Gu Ran's friend.

251
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
Hello.

252
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,840
Gu Ran is a lively one.

253
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,200
I am already surprised

254
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,920
that he has a quiet friend like Lurang.

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,440
I didn't expect this young lady

256
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,040
to be gentle and quiet too.

257
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,600
Zaizai!

258
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,680
Did you fall? Where are you hurt?

259
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,840
Doctor, is my friend okay?

260
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,120
I'm fine.

261
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,680
This is Gu Ran's dad.

262
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,000
Gu Ran's...

263
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,040
Hello, Dad.

264
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,680
Hello, Mr. Gu.

265
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,880
I'm Gu Ran's friend. My name is Jiang Jia.

266
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,920
This girl's personality

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,480
is quite similar to that of Gu Ran's.

268
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,640
It's almost time.

269
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,120
Let's go get the CT scan result.

270
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,480
We still have to dress your wound.

271
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,400
Jiangjiang, wait for us here.

272
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,120
Mr. Gu, please excuse us.

273
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,320
Go ahead. Be careful.

274
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,160
Mr. Gu.

275
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,480
Have you had breakfast?

276
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,560
Let's hurry up.

277
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,960
Jiangjiang is afraid
of being alone with elders.

278
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,280
She must be at a loss for words now.

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,920
I don't think so.

280
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,320
Why?

281
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,080
Mr. Gu is very talkative.

282
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
He usually chats

283
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,720
with Gu Ran's friends.

284
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
Does he? What does he chat about?

285
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,720
How do you know I don't like breakfast?

286
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,640
You even know I don't like vegetables.

287
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,960
From my observation,

288
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,320
you have a yellowish complexion.

289
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,080
You did not have breakfast,

290
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,560
but still hiccuped several times.

291
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,800
You probably

292
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,080
have a digestive system problem.

293
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,720
You must've been staying up late recently.

294
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,480
Yes, that's right.

295
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,400
You guys should not harm your bodies

296
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,960
just because you're young.

297
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,400
It's very bad for your health.

298
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,840
If you're lucky,
you'll have minor abdominal pain.

299
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,480
Worse, you'll get stomach problems.

300
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,240
I'll always eat breakfast from now on.

301
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,600
Mr. Gu,

302
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,240
can you cure hair loss?

303
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,320
What?

304
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,480
Hey, Ms. Bai.

305
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,960
Xiaoran, are you here to see Mr. Gu?

306
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,400
I'm bringing him the keys.

307
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,800
Is my dad in his office?

308
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
He should be there.

309
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,080
-I'll head there.
-Okay.

310
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,560
Jiang Jia?

311
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,560
Dad?

312
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,840
Why are they together?

313
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,240
Don't be discouraged.

314
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,120
I think you still have hope.

315
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,360
I'm only 17.

316
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,240
Indeed.

317
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,680
It's really rare

318
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,040
among people of your age.

319
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
What should I do?

320
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,560
Mr. Gu,

321
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,160
you must keep it a secret for me.

322
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,120
Sure.

323
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Jiang Jia is...

324
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,920
Gu Ran?

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
Hey, Xiaoran.

326
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,200
Did your mom ask you to bring me the keys?

327
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,680
I left early in the morning and...

328
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Dad, be quiet.

329
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,120
I was ignorant and often made you angry.

330
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,800
I apologize to you.

331
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,240
Actually,

332
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,880
I stole the snacks you bought last time.

333
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,000
I also broke your new water glass.

334
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,760
I was also the one
who threw the basketball

335
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,880
that hit you during gym class.

336
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,680
I was wondering why I've been so unlucky.

338
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,320
-So it was you.
-How long has it been?

339
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,280
What do you mean?

340
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,920
I heard everything you two just said.

341
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,240
Why were you eavesdropping?

342
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,840
If I hadn't done so,

343
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,640
were you planning
on hiding it from me forever?

344
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,680
Why would I tell you this?

345
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,280
You're sick. It's a big deal.

346
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,880
What if I don't see you in the future?

347
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,800
What are you talking about?

348
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,400
I'm not sick.

349
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,880
Don't hide it. I know everything.

350
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,920
Zaizai fell from her bike.

351
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,120
I just came to see her.

352
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,240
Su Zaizai?

353
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,240
Don't use her as an excuse.

354
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,280
Gu Ran?

355
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,200
I just hurt my leg.

356
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,920
Why is everyone here?

357
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,520
Are you not sick?

358
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,280
What were you two talking about just now?

359
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,960
Why do you always have so many questions?

360
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,440
Dad, why were you talking about hope?

361
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,880
Hope!

362
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,880
What hope?

363
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,040
I said you guys are

364
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,319
the hope of the motherland.

365
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,160
Zaizai, are you done? Let's go.

366
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,880
-Bye, Mr. Gu.
-Wait!

367
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,800
The keys.

368
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,120
Dad, let's talk at home.

369
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,080
Mr. Gu, I trust you.

370
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,400
Okay.

371
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,520
Mr. Gu, we're leaving first.

372
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,920
Okay.

373
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,040
Be careful on the way home.

374
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,600
Okay. Bye, Mr. Gu.

375
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,880
-Bye.
-Bye.

376
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
Do you really not need me to see you home?

377
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,400
No, I'm fine.

378
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,800
Zhang Lurang will see me home.

379
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,000
I will see her home.

380
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,960
Okay. I have something to do,
so I'll leave first.

381
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
I'll visit you tomorrow.

382
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,920
It's just a little hair loss.

383
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's not obvious, right?

384
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,320
EXIT

385
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
Has Jiang Jia been
having headaches lately?

386
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,440
Headaches?

387
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,880
I don't think so.

388
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,840
If he finds out,
he will definitely laugh at me.

389
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,000
It's Qianyu.

390
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,160
Where?

391
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,640
What are you doing?

392
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Are you really not sick?

393
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,160
You are the one who is sick.

394
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,560
Didn't I tell you already?

395
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,840
I was there to check on Zaizai

396
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,520
and ran into your dad by chance.

397
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,440
-We were just casually chatting.
-That's a relief.

398
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,680
It's great that you're not sick.

399
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,200
You don't have to say anything else.

400
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,880
Are you going
to ask your dad at home tonight?

401
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,960
You're being paranoid.

402
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,800
I'll be asleep
by the time my parents get home.

403
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,080
We have no time to chat.

404
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
Are they that busy?

405
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,880
Doesn't that mean you'll be home alone?

406
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,040
And no one will boss me around.

407
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,480
Envious?

408
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,720
Who would be envious of that?

409
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,400
Were you planning
to get a false medical note

410
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,040
to get out of the 1,000 m race?

411
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,600
Only you would do
this kind of thing, okay?

412
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,720
The 1,000 m is nothing to me.

413
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,480
What are you laughing at?
Don't you believe me?

414
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,680
I didn't say that.

415
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,680
Which floor do you live on?

416
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,400
The third floor.

417
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,520
It's the first unit
on the right of the elevator.

418
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,840
Do you want to come in for a bit?

419
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,920
{\an8}But if you don't pick up Susu,

420
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,760
she may think you are abandoning her.

421
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,280
You should go.

422
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,640
I can go upstairs by myself.

423
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,960
Okay. Remember to apply the ointment.

424
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,760
And you really left this Susu behind.

425
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,760
Are they back so soon?

426
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,360
I'm coming.

427
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,400
This is for you.

428
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
Did you buy rice noodle rolls for me?

429
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,400
Yes.

430
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
I'm leaving now.

431
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,720
Hey, wait a minute.

432
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,920
I'll give you my favorite jelly.

433
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,320
Do you like eating jelly?

434
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,960
When I'm unhappy, I'll feel better

435
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,560
after eating some jelly.

436
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,560
Why?

437
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,840
I don't know either.

438
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,760
I'm asking why you're unhappy.

439
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,520
Rangrang,

440
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,040
I never knew

441
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,200
you cared about me so much.

442
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
What time are you going

443
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,280
to school tomorrow?

444
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,640
I'll take you to and from school

445
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,920
until you are healed.

446
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,880
It was Susu's fault after all.

447
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,760
You offered.

448
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Do you want to eat it?

449
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,800
But you made a mistake today.

450
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,400
So your punishment is no snacks today.

451
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,880
{\an8}Hand.

452
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,960
Good night.

453
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,000
-I'm so jealous.
-Me too.

454
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,080
Please take care of her
when she is in class.

455
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,560
No problem.

456
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Well,

457
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm leaving then.

458
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,600
See you after school.

459
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,360
Zaizai,

460
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,640
what is going on between you two?

461
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,720
It's obvious.

462
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,040
I am his creditor.

463
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,320
In short,

464
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,440
Su Zaizai hurt her leg

465
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,880
because of Zhang Lurang.

466
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,080
Then are you backing out
of the sports meet?

467
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,720
Can't you read the room?

468
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,080
Who cares about the sports meet?

469
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,240
It's a miracle
that she could come to class.

470
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm jealous.

471
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,400
Although I can't join the competition,

472
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,320
I can still contribute.

473
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,720
Aren't you worried
that we have no photographer?

474
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,800
Give me the camera.

475
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,760
Leave it to me to take the pictures.

476
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,520
Have you ever used a camera?

477
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,440
Don't underestimate me.

478
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,680
I was born

479
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,800
to be a photographer.

480
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,080
I'm a natural at taking photos.

481
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,120
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

482
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,520
<i>I want to eat spare ribs, braised pork,</i>

483
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,760
<i>and pork trotters.</i>

484
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,960
WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?

485
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,200
<i>I want you</i>

486
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,520
<i>to bring them to me.</i>

487
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,960
This is quite different from my camera.

488
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,200
<i>Today is October 12th.</i>

489
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
<i>The weather is sunny</i>

490
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,400
<i>with a slight breeze.</i>

491
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,160
<i>It's a great pleasure to meet you</i>

492
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,480
<i>at the</i> Voice of the Campus.

493
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,680
<i>There is a quote</i>

494
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,240
<i>from Han Han's</i> A Fortress.

495
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,920
<i>"This is the way things work.</i>

496
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,120
<i>It takes only a moment</i>

497
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,080
<i>for you to fall in love with something.</i>

498
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,240
<i>You then spend years</i>

499
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,160
<i>asking yourself</i>

500
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,360
<i>why you like it."</i>

501
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,720
<i>Does it still hurt to walk?</i>

502
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,080
<i>Yes, it hurts so much.</i>

503
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,440
Jiangjiang, I'm leaving first.

504
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,400
Is her leg

505
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,280
all better now?

506
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,720
Zhang Lurang.

507
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,880
Youngsters nowadays.

508
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,040
Zaizai, how is your leg?

509
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
I'll pick you up from school
for the next few days.

510
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,400
It's out of your way to work.

511
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,800
The road I used to take

512
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,120
is under maintenance.

513
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,120
My detour passes by your school.

514
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,320
By the way,

515
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,120
when I passed by their school today,

516
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,080
I saw a boy carrying a girl on a bicycle.

517
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,120
They were in school uniforms.

518
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,040
They are so young.

519
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,320
Zaizai, don't be like them.

520
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,800
Boys nowadays are sweet-talkers.

521
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,160
But it doesn't mean anything

522
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,560
to carry a person on a bike.

523
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,320
Maybe the girl was injured

524
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,640
and couldn't walk.

525
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,560
Besides, you shouldn't
call someone a sweet-talker

526
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,840
just because they are handsome.

527
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,040
That makes sense too.

528
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,320
How do you know what that boy looked like?

529
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,360
I was just guessing.

530
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,760
Our school has
quite a lot of handsome guys.

531
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,520
The sports meet is tomorrow.

532
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,960
I'm going to rest.

533
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,360
<i>The annual school sports meet has begun.</i>

534
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,440
<i>The magnificence of soldiers
on the battlefield</i>

535
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,960
<i>returns to our gym once again.</i>

536
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,560
The pursuit of speed makes us faster.

537
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,800
The pursuit of strength
makes us go higher and stronger.

538
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,160
<i>We put our will to the test</i>

539
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
<i>to challenge our limits.</i>

540
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,880
<i>All the best to all the athletes</i>

541
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,320
<i>in the sports meet.</i>

542
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
<i>Ignite your passion.</i>

543
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,920
GRADE 10, CLASS 9, GRADE 10, CLASS 1

544
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,360
I drank hot water. I feel much better now.

545
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,560
But I probably
won't be able to run 1,000 m.

546
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,960
If my leg was fully healed,

547
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,680
one of us could have joined the event.

548
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,360
You should feel fortunate.

549
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,080
Why?

550
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,400
Have you seen
the photos of the sports meet

551
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,920
in the school newspaper every year?

552
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,400
Come, I'll show you.

553
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,720
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

554
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,440
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

555
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,760
Get set!

556
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,560
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

557
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,080
{\an8}-Go for it!
-Go for it!

558
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,520
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

559
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

560
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,240
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

561
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,760
Yes!

562
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,000
Awesome!

563
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,640
We won!

564
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,360
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

565
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,600
Get set.

566
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,440
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

567
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,160
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

568
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,160
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

569
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,040
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

570
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,920
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

571
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,320
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

572
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,840
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

573
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,400
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

574
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,760
This sports meet

575
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,600
is basically a major disaster.

576
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,800
I suddenly feel so lucky.

577
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,920
-You can do this!
-You've got this!

578
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,360
-Nice job!
-Go for it!

579
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,000
What are they doing over there?

580
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,280
-Go!
-Go!

581
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,000
The faculty competition, I think.

582
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,760
I think Mr. Lin is participating too.

583
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,640
-Let's go.
-Let's go take a look.

584
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,080
-Go!
-Mr. Lin, go for it!

585
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,120
-Go!
-Go!

586
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,400
Mr. Lin.

587
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,080
What a good figure you have!

588
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,880
I usually...

589
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,760
{\an8}Mr. Chang is even fitter.

590
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
I bet you exercise regularly.

591
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,520
You have muscles all over.

592
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,520
It's pinching my hand.

593
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,560
Your legs are so long!

594
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,040
Your legs are twice as long as mine!

595
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,520
How can we compete with you?

596
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Who can outrun you?

597
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,160
I just like exercising.

598
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,760
-I love playing ball.
-Really?

599
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,680
I like playing ball too.

600
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,240
What kind of ball do you usually play?

601
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,480
Yo-yo.

602
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,400
My son loves to play it.

603
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,000
So I play with him.

604
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,120
It's a tough workout.

605
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,240
This...

606
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,360
Get set.

607
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,520
It's starting.

608
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,680
-Go!
-Go!

609
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,280
Ready.

610
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,840
Go for it!

611
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,040
Do your best!

612
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,480
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

613
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,040
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

614
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,680
-Go, Mr. Lin!
-Go for it!

615
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,480
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

616
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,080
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

617
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,320
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

618
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,960
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

619
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,080
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

620
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,800
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

621
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,120
-Yes!
-Yes!

622
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,760
He won!

623
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,440
Look at you guys.

624
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,280
You don't work out, don't you?

625
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,240
It's not that we don't work out.

626
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,080
You were running too fast!

627
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,440
Look how tired Mr. Lin is.

628
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,760
He almost couldn't breathe.

629
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,000
I mean, almost fainted.

630
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,400
That's true.

631
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,400
-I'm totally spent.
-Look at him.

632
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,680
Almost fainted?

633
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,240
-Just don't be faint-hearted.
-Indeed.

634
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,480
Xiaoxiao.

635
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,600
It's normal that you couldn't catch up.

636
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,400
Last year, I got first place.

637
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,720
Yes, indeed.

638
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,080
In the future,

639
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,480
you guys need to exercise more.

640
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,400
Of course.

641
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,240
Let's go.

642
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,400
Goodbye, Mr. Chang!

643
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,400
Goodness. I'm exhausted.

644
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,680
Su Zaizai,

645
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,800
isn't the tug of war about to start?

646
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,400
-Did you bring the camera?
-Yes.

647
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,120
Good. Take more pictures.

648
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,240
It's about to start. Let's hurry there.

649
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,040
-Mr. Lin, we'll be going first.
-Okay.

650
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,440
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

651
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,760
How is it going?

652
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,120
Handsome just defeated Class 3.

653
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,560
Now they are going against Class 4.

654
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,240
-Go for it!
-Go for it, Handsome!

655
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,160
-Go for it!
-Go for it, Handsome!

656
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,160
-Go for it!
-Go for it, Handsome!

657
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,440
-Go for it!
-Go for it, Handsome!

658
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,200
-Go for it!
-Go for it, Handsome!

659
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,440
-Go for it!
-Go for it, Handsome!

660
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,040
-Go for it!
-Go for it, Handsome!

661
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,200
-Go for it!
-Go for it, Handsome!

662
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,600
-Go for it!
-Go for it, Handsome.

663
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,640
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

664
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,800
Su Zaizai, keep cheering.

665
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,160
Why are you getting quieter?

666
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,640
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

667
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,800
Well, my voice is a little hoarse.

668
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,640
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

669
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,520
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

670
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,720
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

671
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,600
<i>Participants in the men's 100 m relay,</i>

672
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,640
<i>please come to the check-in area.</i>

673
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,560
<i>Participants in the men's 100 m relay,</i>

674
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,320
<i>please come to the check-in area.</i>

675
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,840
Rangrang, are you about to run
the 100 m race?

676
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,120
Then I'll cheer you on.

677
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,880
If you don't say anything,

678
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,320
I'll take that as a yes.

679
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,680
But there are so many people.

680
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,240
You might not hear my voice.

681
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,720
Maybe I can borrow
the referee's loudspeaker.

682
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,120
Weren't you cheering loudly

683
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,280
during the tug-of-war match?

684
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,800
That was for our class rep.

685
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,920
His name is Wang Nan.

686
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,760
We usually call him Handsome.

687
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,240
It's his nickname.

688
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,440
Are you

689
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,200
jealous?

690
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,560
No.

691
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,440
If not, why would you remember it?

692
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,600
I was just asking.

693
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,440
<i>After pretending all day,</i>

694
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,920
<i>I can finally walk normally.</i>

695
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,520
<i>I almost got caught today.</i>

696
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,160
<i>Luckily, I realized it in time.</i>

697
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,840
<i>It's such a headache
that my leg is healed.</i>

698
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,640
<i>I wonder how much longer</i>

699
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,480
<i>I can sit on the back of Rangrang's bike.</i>

700
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,040
<i>Whatever.</i>

701
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,440
<i>I will delay it as long as I can.</i>

702
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,920
<i>Su Zaizai.</i>

703
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,840
I'm sorry.

704
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,760
<i>Today was another day of being Pinocchio.</i>

705
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,040
<i>My nose had better not grow longer.</i>

706
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,720
<i>What if I won't look cute anymore?</i>
