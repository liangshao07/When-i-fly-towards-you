<i>Three, two, one!</i>

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,040
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

4
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,000
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,240
<i>You Are More Charming Than the Scenery.</i>

6
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,240
Sir.

7
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,440
Crybaby.

8
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,000
You're the crybaby.

9
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,160
My name is Doudou.

10
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,640
He strayed away from his teacher.

11
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,160
Let's take him to the broadcast station.

12
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,200
Let's go.

13
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,760
I'll take you to your teacher.

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,640
No, I want him to hold my hand.

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,440
You're not the only one. I...

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,240
I also think

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,160
you should let him hold your hand.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,200
Otherwise, we might both get lost.

19
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,160
Let's go.

20
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,800
{\an8}<i>Welcome to Jiangyi Aquarium.</i>

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,520
{\an8}<i>Please keep your valuable items with you</i>

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,760
<i>and keep them safe.</i>

23
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,440
Valuable items,

24
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,800
you must follow me carefully.

25
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,160
Sir.

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,520
She looks like she wants to eat you.

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,400
What are you saying?

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
That's how she looked
when she looked at the fish just now.

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,520
No.

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,760
Didn't he say I acted like that

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,640
because I thought it was adorable

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,880
and liked it very much?

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,360
Come, I'll show you the big turtles.

34
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,360
{\an8}Do you see that? It's a huge turtle.

35
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,040
Thank you so much.

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
As soon as I turned around, he was gone.

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,520
-Luckily, he met you.
-You're welcome.

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,640
We were heading this way anyway.

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,560
By the way,

40
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,760
I'll give you
these aquarium souvenir keychains

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,960
as a thank you.

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,480
Are they exactly the same?

43
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,600
There are also different ones.

44
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
No, it's okay.

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,840
I want the same ones.

46
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,160
Thank you.

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,080
If there's nothing else, we'll get going.

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,520
Say goodbye to them.

49
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,840
Bye.

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,880
-Bye.
-Bye.

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,280
Rangrang,

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
when you were holding Doudou's hand,

53
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,520
I thought I saw us ten years from now.

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,440
Well...

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
Forget it.

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,640
Kids say whatever they want.

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,800
Here. We each get one.

58
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,440
Now you've been to Jiangyi Aquarium.

59
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,680
This is proof.

60
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
Let's go.

61
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,800
Other than the school uniform,

62
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,600
this is the second item we have in common.

63
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,079
It's incredibly meaningful.

64
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,440
I must make sure

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,880
that it can be seen at all times.

66
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,040
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,440
<i>What doomsday?</i>

68
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,280
It's the 21st.

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,520
It's after the academic competition.

70
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,440
People on the forum made it sound so real.

71
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,800
They said it was a Mayan prophecy.

72
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Do you really believe in doomsday?

73
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
I didn't believe it at first.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,400
But many people say it's true.

75
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,240
And don't you think

76
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,520
the weather has been a bit weird lately?

77
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,240
They all say this is a sign of doomsday.

78
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,520
Yes, that's right.

79
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,040
The moon was especially huge last night.

80
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,000
The prophecy also says

81
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,800
that the sun won't rise again
after doomsday.

82
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,120
That's so mystical.

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,240
Will anyone really believe that?

84
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
Don't online forum posters try to come up

85
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
with the most convincing stories?

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,080
Signs of impending doomsday?

87
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,520
Only fools would believe that.

88
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,120
Why are you looking at me?

89
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,440
I don't believe it.

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,560
{\an8}Says the one who was speaking
so confidently just now.

91
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,560
{\an8}Me?

92
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,440
{\an8}I was trying to educate all of you.

93
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
I want you to keep up
with this current hot topic.

94
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,600
Got it?

95
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
You guys are the noisiest on this floor.

96
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,320
Is this what an honors class is like?

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,240
Before we start our lesson,

98
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,400
I want to emphasize
the academic competition.

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,760
Half of our class

100
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,560
will participate in this competition.

101
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,920
Though it's not very difficult,

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,280
it still tests what we have learned
during this period.

103
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,240
I hope you don't take it too lightly.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
Keep your admission tickets safe.

105
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,240
If anything happens while you are there,

106
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,000
contact the teacher in charge immediately.

107
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,600
Do you understand?

108
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,040
{\an8}-Yes.
-Yes.

109
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,120
The exam is only two days away.

110
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
You have no sense of urgency at all.

111
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,320
Every class year gets worse.

112
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,960
Every class year gets worse.

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Focus on the exercises.

114
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,040
Rangrang,

115
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,600
have you heard about doomsday?

116
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
Do you actually believe it?

117
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
Everyone is talking about it.

118
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,880
Rangrang,

119
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,760
if it really is true,

120
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,880
what would you find most regrettable?

121
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,600
Not coming to Jiangyi earlier.

122
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,520
Same here.

123
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,680
It would have been great
to have known you earlier.

124
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
But it's not too late now.

125
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,080
We still have plenty of time ahead.

126
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,520
So you don't believe in doomsday anymore.

127
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,680
Even if it's true,

128
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
I still got to know you.

129
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,760
<i>Come, Zaizai.</i>

130
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,920
Bring some fruit.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,480
I've washed them. Eat them on the way.

132
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,880
Mom, my bag is already full.

133
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,640
If you take out this junk food,

134
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
then it will fit.

135
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,480
You're going to a competition,

136
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
not an outing.

137
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,800
Let her eat whatever she likes.

138
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,360
She doesn't eat it every day. Right?

139
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,240
You're the one who has spoiled her.

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,960
Here, Jiajia.

141
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,720
-Have some fruit.
-Thank you, Mrs. Zhang.

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,680
You're welcome.

143
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,240
What time is your train tomorrow?

144
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,160
I'll give you a ride.

145
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,680
It's okay. It's at ten o'clock.

146
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,200
We can get there ourselves in time.

147
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,160
All right then.

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Okay. Then let's go.

149
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,360
Sleep early, okay?

150
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,800
-Don't stay up too late.
-Sleep early.

151
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,160
Be at your best.

152
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,160
I know.

153
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,840
Good luck.

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,080
Jiangjiang, do you think this counts

155
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,880
as my first trip with Rangrang?

156
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,120
Over 100 others are going with us.

157
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,559
Do they not count as people?

158
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,960
Why aren't you excited at all?

159
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,520
What is exciting about going to an exam?

160
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,680
You're excited
because Zhang Lurang is also going.

161
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Qianyu is not going.

162
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,120
Speaking of which, when do you plan
to give him the jar of stars?

163
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,880
I don't know.

164
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,520
It doesn't feel like the right time yet.

165
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,280
What if he doesn't accept it?

166
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,320
It's simple. Give it to him again.

167
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,280
I wish I had your courage.

168
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,360
If only I were bold.

169
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
It's all Rangrang's fault.

170
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,000
He's great.

171
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,520
He has good grades, good looks,

172
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
and a great personality.

173
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,960
You're praising him too much.

174
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,040
We always think people we like
are perfect in every way.

175
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,000
So tell me.

176
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,280
Do you think Qianyu has any flaws?

177
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,760
He...

178
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,000
He's too perfect.

179
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,520
Do you see?

180
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,760
You judge me
when you're also completely obsessed.

181
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,960
You're obsessed too.

182
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,000
No, I'm not.

183
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,120
-You are.
-You're the obsessed one!

184
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,920
Why are those two still not here?

185
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,320
Can you not reach them?

186
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,240
<i>Sorry, the subscriber you dialed...</i>

187
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,800
She's not answering.

188
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,840
What time is it?

189
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,280
Zaizai!

190
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,240
What?

191
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,640
-Are we taking the ten o'clock train?
-Yes.

192
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,400
Look at the time now.

193
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
What are you waiting for?

194
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,200
Let's hurry to the train station!

195
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,320
Are you planning

196
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,360
to run after the train on foot?

197
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,880
You have a point.

198
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,400
Let's take the bus.

199
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,840
I'll text Gu Ran.

200
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,360
<i>Rangrang, don't worry.</i>

201
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,800
<i>We'll be arriving a little later
than you guys.</i>

202
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
<i>Are you taking the bus?</i>

203
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,720
<i>Yes.</i>

204
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,240
<i>Do you know how long it will take?</i>

205
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,280
How long will it take by bus?

206
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,280
Seven hours.

207
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,000
It'll be dark when we arrive.

208
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,040
Just sleep.

209
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,160
We'll be there when we wake up.

210
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,440
I missed my first train trip

211
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,440
with Rangrang.

212
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,680
I will never forget to set the alarm.

213
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,840
Are you going out?

214
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,720
Where are you going?

215
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,040
The bus station.

216
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,440
The bus station?

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,960
Has Jiang Jia arrived?

218
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,440
I'll go with you.

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,760
Well, if I don't go when you're going,

220
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,280
Jiang Jia will bad-mouth me again.

221
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,640
Come on. Let's go.

222
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,640
Yong'an is colder than Jiangyi.

223
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
I'm sure
careless Jiang Jia didn't realize.

224
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,600
Come on.

225
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,920
Rangrang?

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,040
Why are you here?

227
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
Did you come just to pick me up?

228
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
It has been a long time.

229
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,240
You just saw me yesterday.

230
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,760
You're so welcome.

231
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,480
Hold this for me.

232
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,680
Exactly what I need.

233
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,680
I just bought this.

234
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,280
They're still hot. Have a quick bite.

235
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,080
There are other places
to eat near the hotel.

236
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,920
Thank you.

237
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,960
Let's head back.

238
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,120
Why aren't our rooms assigned together?

239
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,120
That's too bad.

240
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,280
I thought I could chat with you tonight.

241
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,760
That's because you arrived late.

242
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,120
Room 413.

243
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,560
Room 412.

244
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,080
Room 411. I'm here.

245
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,320
I'll go inside first. Bye.

246
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,680
-Okay.
-Bye.

247
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,640
Sleep early. Bye.

248
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,640
Bye.

249
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,960
So where is your room?

250
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
Room 401. It's up ahead.

251
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,080
It's quite near my room. I'm in Room 407.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,160
The exam is at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

253
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,440
-So you...
-Don't worry about me.

254
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,640
I won't be late.

255
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,520
I mean to say,

256
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
don't silence your phone.

257
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,120
I can call you.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Okay.

259
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,400
I'll go inside then.

260
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,360
Bye.

261
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,560
-Bye.
-Bye.

262
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,200
Who's there?

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
Hello, I'm Su Zaizai.

264
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,800
I'll be sharing the room with you.

265
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,280
Hello, I'm Xia Ning.

266
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,880
Have you had dinner?

267
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,240
I have snacks. Do you want some?

268
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,560
Thank you, but I've already eaten.

269
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,600
Which school are you from?

270
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,520
Suyang No. 1 High School. What about you?

271
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
The First High School
Affiliated to Jiangyi University.

272
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,440
The First High School
Affiliated to Jiangyi University?

273
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,760
Is there a guy named Zhang Lurang

274
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,760
in your school?

275
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,360
He should be quite popular.

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,960
Zhang Lurang?

277
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,920
I know him.

278
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,880
Is he also participating
in this competition?

279
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720
Time sure flies.

280
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,240
It has been almost two years

281
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,600
since we last met.

282
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
I wonder if he still remembers me.

283
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,960
Do you two

284
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,560
know each other?

285
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,520
Yes. We went to the same junior high.

286
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,520
My dad was even his physics teacher.

287
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,120
Is he interested in anyone

288
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,960
at your school?

289
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,240
I don't think he has one.

290
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,520
But there are people
who are interested in him.

291
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
That's for sure. He's so outstanding.

292
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,640
He probably registered
for physics this time too.

293
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,320
Maybe we'll be

294
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,160
in the same examination hall.

295
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,360
Lurang,

296
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,360
aren't you going to bed?

297
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,400
Sleep first. You can turn off the lights.

298
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,600
I can use the table lamp.

299
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,680
You're making me so stressed.

300
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,040
Even though the exam is tomorrow,

301
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
we should take it easy

302
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,240
before the competition.

303
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,360
How about a game?

304
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,200
No.

305
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,280
I'm afraid I might dream of you

306
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
doing exercise problems.

307
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,080
<i>Rangrang, are you asleep?</i>

308
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,960
<i>Not yet.</i>

309
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,200
<i>I knew it.</i>

310
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
<i>I know you too well.</i>

311
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,800
<i>My roommate is from Suyang.</i>

312
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,840
<i>Her name is Xia Ning.</i>

313
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,680
<i>She said she knows you.</i>

314
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,520
<i>Okay.</i>

315
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,319
What does that mean?

316
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,280
Does he know her?

317
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,560
Are they close or not?

318
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,560
<i>Do you still remember her?</i>

319
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,599
<i>I think so.</i>

320
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,040
He thinks so.

321
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,880
That means they're not close.

322
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,280
<i>We participated in many competitions.</i>

323
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,640
<i>Her results were pretty good.</i>

324
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,080
<i>She's really good at physics.</i>

325
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,200
He remembers her results clearly.

326
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,400
By the way, Zaizai,

327
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,040
what subject are you taking in the exam?

328
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,400
I haven't asked you.

329
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
English.

330
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,160
I'm bad at science subjects.

331
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,000
Being good at English
is very impressive too.

332
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,120
Many of those who are good at science

333
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,360
are bad at English.

334
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,240
Zhang Lurang is one of them.

335
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
I wonder if he has improved.

336
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,640
Someone is tutoring him,
so he has improved a lot.

337
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,320
His tutor is especially skilled.

338
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,840
She's hardworking and patient.

339
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,320
His grades have improved a lot now.

340
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,080
That's great to hear.

341
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,400
By the way,

342
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,280
there must be many top students

343
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,760
in Suyang, right?

344
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,560
There must've been quite a lot
in junior high, right?

345
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,120
Yes, we do have some,

346
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,880
but not many are well-known.

347
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,320
Was Zhang Lurang famous?

348
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,720
Of course.

349
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,880
Almost every female student

350
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
in school knew of him.

351
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,320
Then such a popular guy

352
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,440
must have liked someone, right?

353
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,880
Yes.

354
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,880
Who?

355
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,080
Susu.

356
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,320
Susu?

357
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,000
Susu, I see.

358
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,400
What?

359
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,720
Do you know he has a pet named Susu?

360
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,600
I've seen it once or twice.

361
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,680
<i>I wonder if Rangrang</i>

362
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,320
ran into Xia Ning

363
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,960
during the final physics exam.

364
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,160
Rangrang!

365
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,440
I thought you finished

366
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,720
half an hour earlier than me.

367
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,000
Are you here waiting for me?

368
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,000
I just got out.

369
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,040
That also counts.

370
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,120
Where are Jiangjiang and the others?
Have they left?

371
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,720
It's bad enough that she didn't see us.

372
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,560
She even suspected that we had left.

373
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,320
That's too much.

374
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,040
Well, you may not know

375
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,760
that I've been developing nearsightedness.

376
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,600
Come on. Drinks are on me.

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,880
That's more like it.

378
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,240
THE NINTH
HUAYI CUP ACADEMIC COMPETITION

379
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
We're leaving in two days.

380
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,760
Let's go and have fun tomorrow.

381
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,920
Sure.

382
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,280
Since we're already here,

383
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,000
it'll be a loss if we don't have fun.

384
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,760
Lurang!

385
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,040
Mr. Xia.

386
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,000
I didn't believe it
when Xiaoning said you were here.

387
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,760
It turns out that she knows you best.

388
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,600
Hello, everyone.

389
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,120
I'm an old friend of Lurang's.

390
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,320
I've been sharing a room with Zaizai
these two days.

391
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,560
"Lurang"?

392
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,560
Are you all done with the exam?

393
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,960
Why aren't you going out
for some fun then?

394
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,520
We were planning to.

395
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,160
Perfect.

396
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,640
Let Xia Ning show you guys around.

397
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,120
She has been to Yong'an many times.

398
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,400
She's familiar with this place.

399
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,360
She can be your tour guide.

400
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,760
Since you haven't
seen each other in a while,

401
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,760
you can catch up.

402
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,360
Now we can consider ourselves acquainted.

403
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,560
Let's hang out together.

404
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,200
She has known him for a long time,

405
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,680
much longer than I have.

406
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,760
They might just be ordinary friends.

407
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,840
We rarely get to travel
and this is a snack street.

408
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,800
Cheer up.

409
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,240
Don't let anything spoil the food.

410
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,360
Jiang Jia, Su Zaizai, do you want to eat?

411
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Come on. Let's go.

412
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
<i>It's quite nice, isn't it?</i>

413
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,560
The scenery gets even better up ahead.

414
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,640
So do you come here often?

415
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,160
You can say so. I grew up here.

416
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,520
So I can be your tour guide.

417
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,200
Up ahead
is Yong'an's famous Mount Xiaolan.

418
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,320
Since it's Monday,
it shouldn't be crowded.

419
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,080
Do you want to go up and explore?

420
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,000
Sure.

421
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
I heard the entire Yong'an
is visible from the top.

422
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,160
Yes.

423
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,400
That's why visitors always go up.

424
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,560
-Let's go.
-We're already here.

425
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
We have to take a look.

426
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,680
You guys go ahead.

427
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,680
My shoes are chafing my heels.

428
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,600
It will be bad
if I can't make it back down.

429
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,960
I'll wait for you here.

430
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,720
I'll stay and keep you company.

431
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,640
It's okay.

432
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,520
You should take photos
to show your parents.

433
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,040
I'll stay here. I won't wander off.

434
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,240
Okay then.

435
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
I know a shortcut.

436
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,280
We'll come back as soon as possible.

437
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
If you're bored,
you can buy some snacks down there.

438
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,120
Okay.

439
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,920
Lurang, let's go.

440
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,360
I did say I'm not going.

441
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,800
But are you really leaving me here?

442
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,600
Why didn't you go with them?

443
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,080
I'm tired. I don't want to go.

444
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,480
So you went to buy jelly for me.

445
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,640
Didn't you say

446
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,080
eating jelly makes you feel better

447
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,520
when you're in a bad mood?

448
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,880
It'll be an hour or two

449
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,160
before they come down.

450
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,240
Why don't we go and enjoy the view?

451
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,680
Enjoy the view? Where?

452
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,520
If Jiang Jia knew

453
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,760
there was a direct cable car,

454
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,960
she would be so annoyed.

455
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,360
However,

456
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,400
this is really high up.

457
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Are you scared?

458
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,520
What is there to be scared of

459
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
when I'm with you?

460
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,400
<i>Rangrang, you seem to enjoy</i>

461
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,880
<i>being in high places.</i>

462
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,920
<i>I noticed it when we were
at the amusement park.</i>

463
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,920
<i>Whenever I was upset in the past,</i>

464
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,720
<i>I liked to go to high places.</i>

465
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,920
<i>It made me feel much better.</i>

466
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,720
{\an8}<i>Rangrang,</i>

467
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,200
<i>do you have a lot of worries?</i>

468
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,440
<i>Or...</i>

469
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,080
{\an8}<i>Why don't you try to be like me?</i>

470
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,640
{\an8}<i>I forget my worries quickly.</i>

471
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,200
<i>What would you do?</i>

472
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,480
<i>I'll eat my favorite snacks.</i>

473
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
<i>For example, strawberry jelly,</i>

474
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,960
<i>takoyaki with cheese,</i>

475
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
<i>and the first bite of ice cream.</i>

476
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,600
<i>If none of those work,</i>

477
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,080
<i>I would go to the beach</i>

478
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,160
<i>or watch the sunset.</i>

479
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,280
<i>All of these always improve my mood.</i>

480
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,040
<i>And if...</i>

481
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,880
<i>If none of those work,</i>

482
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,120
<i>then just seeing you will be enough.</i>

483
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,720
<i>Rangrang,</i>

484
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,600
<i>every person's existence is meaningful.</i>

485
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,200
<i>Don't easily dismiss yourself.</i>

486
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,520
<i>For some people,</i>

487
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,160
<i>you're their ultimate solution,</i>

488
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,920
<i>a magical remedy</i>

489
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,680
<i>that can cure everything.</i>

490
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,200
<i>They like this world more</i>

491
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,600
<i>because of you.</i>

492
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,160
<i>Every day, I want to strive harder</i>

493
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
<i>and put in a little more effort</i>

494
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,280
<i>to become a person like that.</i>

495
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,960
<i>But you already are.</i>

496
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
{\an8}Let me carry it.

497
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,440
So you guys ended up taking the cable car.

498
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,200
That's outrageous.

499
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,520
We went up and down the mountain on foot.

500
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,240
My legs are still sore.

501
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,960
Yet you're occupying my bed
when you rode the cable car.

502
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,840
Move over.

503
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,960
Now!

504
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
This is comfortable.

505
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,040
I found the view from the cable car

506
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,200
to be quite beautiful.

507
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,000
Everything looks beautiful to you

508
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,560
{\an8}so long as you're with Zhang Lurang.

509
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,400
We went hiking earlier today.

510
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,160
I think Xia Ning is pretty nice.

511
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,960
She's pretty, kind, and isn't spoiled.

512
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,240
She helped me several times
when I couldn't hike anymore.

513
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,480
Really?

514
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,680
She even bought us some local specialties.

515
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,160
I think she must be popular at school.

516
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Is he doing okay now?

517
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,960
Yes, one time we went out together
for an exchange.

518
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,200
We...

519
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,160
Su Zaizai.

520
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,280
I left something in Jiang Jia's room.

521
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,720
I was just about to retrieve it.

522
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,400
You guys can carry on.

523
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,520
I came for you.

524
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,680
I texted you, but you didn't reply.

525
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,000
The battery ran out.

526
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,520
Well, I happen to need to go out

527
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,520
to buy something.

528
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,320
It's too cold to chat out here.

529
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,360
Talk inside.

530
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,640
Go inside.

531
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,680
What's the matter?

532
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,080
I'll just stand here.

533
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,200
The heating system isn't working properly.

534
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,120
I thought

535
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,160
you might need this.

536
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,320
Thank you.

537
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,320
Then I'll go back now.

538
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,440
Don't stay up too late.

539
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,240
Rangrang.

540
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
Good night.

541
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,720
He's so cute.

542
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,440
Your keychain looks really nice.

543
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,720
Today, I saw that Lurang had the same one.

544
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,320
Are you two...

545
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,600
No.

546
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,600
This is an aquarium souvenir.

547
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,600
They're all the same.

548
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,040
Does Lurang like you?

549
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,000
No.

550
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,760
How could he possibly like me?

551
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,200
He's probably annoyed at me every day.

552
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,400
Why are you nervous?

553
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,880
Then you must like Lurang.

554
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,720
I...

555
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,480
How long have you known him?

556
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,600
Do you know him well?

557
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,840
Do you know what he thinks?

558
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,520
Have I scared you?

559
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,240
I've watched too many television dramas.

560
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,840
So I feel that is what I should say
at a moment like this.

561
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,680
Sorry about that.

562
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,760
But I do think

563
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,080
you don't know him that well.

564
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,120
Let me tell you.

565
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,120
For a guy like him,

566
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,720
it actually takes him a lot of effort

567
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,600
to take every step toward you.

568
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,240
And he usually

569
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,880
won't express his thoughts directly.

570
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,360
Instead,

571
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,240
it's through an action,

572
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,680
a glance,

573
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,960
or even an ordinary sentence

574
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,680
that no one would pay attention to.

575
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,200
He's a guy who excels in academics

576
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,080
and is so popular.

577
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Just so you know,

578
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,520
many people wanted to be friends with him

579
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,080
when we were in junior high.

580
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,400
But he just liked being alone.

581
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
In any case,
you'll gradually understand him.

582
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
There are many things

583
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,040
you have to experience on your own.

584
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,320
But how do you know all of this?

585
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,200
I'm going to study psychology.

586
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,960
So I already knew it

587
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,400
when I first saw you.

588
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,600
What did you know?

589
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,920
You must be

590
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,720
Lurang's most trusted friend.

591
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,800
Sorry for troubling you
these past few days.

592
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,440
It's nothing.

593
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,640
I heard Jiangyi is a nice place.

594
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,120
If I have time,

595
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,360
I would like to visit.

596
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,680
Also, I would like to see what it is

597
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,000
that makes Lurang like it so much.

598
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,600
Then you'll have to stay longer.

599
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,040
You can't experience all of Jiangyi

600
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,600
in one day.

601
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,800
Okay, I'll definitely visit.

602
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,120
It's almost time.

603
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,640
We should head to the train station.

604
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,000
If he walks too slowly,

605
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,680
you can take the initiative

606
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,200
and walk into his world.

607
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,400
Bye.

608
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,760
See you.

609
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,720
Go on. Bye.

610
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,440
-Bye.
-Bye.

611
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,200
Zaizai, why are you still up?

612
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm not sleepy. You can sleep first.

613
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,880
{\an8}Can you live without sleep now?

614
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,880
<i>I can't seem to fall asleep.</i>

615
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,400
<i>I might as well</i>

616
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,000
<i>sleep on the train tomorrow.</i>

617
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,080
<i>It's my first trip to Yong'an.</i>

618
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,360
<i>I wonder what it will be like.</i>

619
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,440
<i>I should make a plan.</i>

620
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,440
<i>We do have some time after the exam.</i>

621
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,120
<i>Shall I go on a boat ride with Rangrang?</i>

622
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,560
<i>Maybe hike a mountain?</i>

623
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,880
<i>I need to make a proper plan.</i>

624
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,760
<i>Had I known</i>

625
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,280
<i>that staying up late would make me
miss the train the next day,</i>

626
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,880
<i>I would've slept early for a change.</i>
