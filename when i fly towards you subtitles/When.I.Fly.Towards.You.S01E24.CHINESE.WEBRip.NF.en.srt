SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,080
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,920
<i>When I Fly Towards You.</i>

6
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,760
-Thank you.
-Bye.

7
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,400
-See you next time.
-See you next time.

8
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,360
-All right.
-Bye.

LUMING TECHNOLOGY, DRONE SEMINAR

10
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,480
Didn't you say you couldn't make it?

11
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,280
But this is your first product talk.

12
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,920
You must have wanted me to be here.

13
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,280
If you're really touched,

14
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,920
give me a substantial reward.

15
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,280
One more.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
It's not a game with extra gameplay

17
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,320
as a prize.

18
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,440
But I've always had good luck.

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
I win a prize every time.

20
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,760
Let me take you somewhere.

21
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,200
Let's go.

22
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,200
What is this place?

23
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,040
Our home.

24
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
I've already bought this house.

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,920
I was planning to bring you here tomorrow.

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,840
See if there is anything you don't like.

27
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,320
{\an8}I have dreamed

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,120
of this scenario many times.

29
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,640
I want

30
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,960
to place a large sofa here.

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,560
And here,

32
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,760
a white television cabinet.

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,760
Here,

34
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,240
I'll hang a blue curtain.

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,760
It's so beautiful.

36
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,280
<i>Today is December 22nd, 2012.</i>

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,960
<i>Doomsday is over.</i>

38
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,040
<i>What are you filming?</i>

39
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,480
<i>Didn't you say</i>

40
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,680
<i>we would be happier</i>

41
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,240
<i>if we record the happy moments?</i>

42
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
<i>I'm trying it out.</i>

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
<i>But you didn't speak</i>

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,960
<i>when I asked you to speak earlier.</i>

45
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
<i>Rangrang, were you shy?</i>

46
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,160
<i>You can tell me in secret first.</i>

47
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,560
<i>No.</i>

48
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,560
<i>May 26th, 2013.</i>

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,440
<i>Mrs. Guan made a new dessert.</i>

50
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,080
<i>Su Zaizai liked it very much</i>

51
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,200
<i>and finished two big bowls.</i>

52
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,200
<i>No, a bowl and a half at most!</i>

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,880
<i>August 7th, 2013.</i>

54
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,839
<i>We watched the sunset in Baichuan today.</i>

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,560
<i>It was fun.</i>

56
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,360
<i>Today is January 15th, 2014.</i>

57
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,520
<i>It's a beautiful day.</i>

58
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,040
<i>It's easy to get sleepy.</i>

59
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,760
{\an8}<i>Rangrang, are you filming me?</i>

60
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,720
{\an8}<i>No.</i>

61
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,360
{\an8}<i>July 28th, 2015.</i>

62
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,600
{\an8}<i>We're in a relationship.</i>

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,400
<i>Today is October 3rd, 2016.</i>

64
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,200
<i>I'm waiting to have a meal with Zaizai.</i>

65
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,080
<i>Five,</i>

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
<i>four,</i>

67
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,200
<i>three,</i>

68
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,160
<i>two.</i>

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,960
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

70
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,680
<i>I'm on a video call with my uncle.</i>

71
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,600
<i>What?</i>

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,800
<i>I'm just kidding.</i>

73
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,480
<i>January 20th, 2017.</i>

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,800
<i>Because of the extra boba in her milk tea,</i>

75
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
<i>she is overjoyed.</i>

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,160
<i>Rangrang!</i>

77
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,760
<i>June 26th, 2020.</i>

78
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
<i>After today's seminar,</i>

79
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,480
<i>I want to propose to her.</i>

80
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,960
For the first 17 years of my life,

81
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,720
I worked hard

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,640
just to keep the name Zhang Lurang alive.

83
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,800
That was until I met you.

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,720
<i>I had more to look forward to.</i>

85
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,960
<i>I looked forward to you
popping up unexpectedly.</i>

86
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,800
<i>I looked forward to sweaty gym classes.</i>

87
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
<i>I looked forward to every bus on Route 74.</i>

88
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,120
I began to look forward to tomorrow.

89
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,840
Maybe

90
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,440
I just looked forward to what you said

91
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,840
<i>every night.</i>

92
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,880
<i>"See you tomorrow."</i>

93
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,440
<i>Then</i>

94
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,320
<i>I always wished</i>

95
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,640
<i>I could spend</i>

96
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
<i>more and more time</i>

97
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,360
<i>with you.</i>

98
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
<i>Later on,</i>

99
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,400
<i>I was no longer satisfied.</i>

100
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,960
<i>I wish</i>

101
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,440
<i>that you are the first person I see</i>

102
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,920
<i>when I wake up in the morning.</i>

103
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,880
<i>I want to watch movies with you</i>

104
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,280
<i>in my free time.</i>

105
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,200
We could go for a walk after dinner.

106
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,520
Perhaps we will

107
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,800
have a child.

108
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,680
I'll teach him math.

109
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,040
You will teach him English.

110
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,160
On his birthday,

111
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,200
we will make a cake for him.

112
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,320
Zaizai,

113
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
shall we get married?

114
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
I have a bank card.

115
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
What? Are you going to provide for me?

116
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,800
All my red packet money
throughout childhood

117
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,400
is inside.

118
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,960
I haven't spent a penny.

119
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
I was saving it to buy rings.

120
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,080
I would like to think

121
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,280
that I've been saving money my whole life

122
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,600
just to marry you.

123
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,840
There is no backing out now.

124
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,280
Zaizai.

125
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,000
The station called me in
at the last minute.

126
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,799
-Did you wait long?
-I just arrived too.

127
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,400
Have you finished your work?

128
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,360
Of course.

129
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,480
My best friend is engaged.

130
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,720
Your unmarried days are numbered.

131
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,160
I can't miss this.

132
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,520
Let's check out wedding dresses.

133
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,480
You can try some too.

134
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,600
I don't want to.

135
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
He hasn't proposed to me yet.

136
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,400
Hello. What's up?

137
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,640
<i>Are you guys done yet?</i>

138
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,800
<i>I'll come and pick you up.</i>

139
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,080
We haven't even started.

140
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,280
Don't worry about me.

141
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,440
I will go back on my own.

142
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,560
Okay, bye now.

143
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,160
<i>Don't you need someone to carry your bags?</i>

144
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,760
<i>Don't you think I'm a good fit?</i>

145
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,560
We don't need that.

146
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,760
I'm hanging up.

147
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,440
We're in a hurry.

148
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
Gu Ran, are you...

149
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,720
Zhang Lurang?

150
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,920
Zaizai is beside me.

151
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,600
Did she not pick up?

152
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,000
Her phone seems to be on silent.

153
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,840
We're not sure when we'll be back yet.

154
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
She will contact you then.

155
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
Okay, bye.

156
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,240
Let's go.

157
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,800
{\an8}-Cheers.
-Cheers.

158
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,960
Time sure flies.

159
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,200
I remember this stall was here

160
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,000
when we were in junior high.

161
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
We used to come here on weekends.

162
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,560
This grilled eggplant is the best.

163
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,240
Zaizai,

164
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,040
I want to ask you something.

165
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,400
People say marriage is the grave of love.

166
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,240
Aren't you afraid

167
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,000
you will regret getting married so early?

168
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,240
Actually,

169
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,680
I regret it already.

170
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,400
What?

171
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,280
I should've proposed to Rangrang earlier.

172
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,080
We could've been celebrating
our wedding anniversary now.

173
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,080
You're kidding again.

174
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm not kidding, Jiangjiang.

175
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
Do you know how much hassle it is

176
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,480
to plan a wedding?

177
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,880
You have to check the guest list

178
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,880
and be involved in the planning.

179
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,640
You have to take care of everything

180
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,960
from the venue to the desserts.

181
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,640
Rangrang never asked me to do it,

182
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
but he worked in secret until midnight.

183
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,880
What makes a marriage worthwhile or not

184
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,360
is your partner's attitude.

185
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,680
I've been in love with Zhang Lurang
for so many years.

186
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,600
If I don't even have
this confidence in him,

187
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
then wouldn't I have a bad taste?

188
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,600
I wish you all the happiness in the world

189
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,040
and forever young.

190
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,960
To us.

191
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,760
Cheers.

192
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,880
Hello.

193
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,080
<i>Hello, Zhang Lurang.</i>

194
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,520
<i>You may have to come.</i>

195
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,840
What's wrong?

196
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,320
<i>Rangrang, come and take your baby home!</i>

197
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
<i>Zaizai, stay still.</i>

198
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,320
Send me your location. I'm coming now.

199
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,240
All right. We'll get going now.

200
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,640
She didn't drink much.

201
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,000
She should be sober in no time.

202
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,200
Drive safely.

203
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,160
Bye.

204
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,440
How was it?
Did you have a good time today?

205
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,640
Yes. I even bought new clothes.

206
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,280
By the way,

207
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
when Zaizai was trying on wedding dresses,

208
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,240
I couldn't resist trying some on.

209
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,160
That shop's wedding dresses
are really pretty.

210
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,640
Jiang Jia.

211
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,640
Why don't we also...

212
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Stop it!

213
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,960
You can't propose so casually.

214
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,880
I'm not dressed up
and my face isn't made up.

215
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,080
No way!

216
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,600
{\an8}I'll wait for you to be ready.

217
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,800
{\an8}Gu Ran, you're so annoying!

218
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,080
{\an8}You're ruining the surprise!

219
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,640
<i>You won me over just like this</i>

220
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,600
<i>All my ways out have been blocked</i>

221
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,720
<i>My...</i>

222
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,600
<i>Something and something</i>

223
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,000
<i>My love and hate are...</i>

224
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,520
Rangrang, am I a good singer?

225
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,720
Yes.

226
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,200
But you don't even applaud.

227
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,480
Rangrang,

228
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,760
your face is so cold.

229
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,640
Are you feeling cold?

230
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,280
Let me warm you up.

231
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,680
Hubby, be good.

232
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,680
What did you call me?

233
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I didn't hear it.

234
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,920
Hubby.

235
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,000
Why can't I warm you up?

236
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,160
Why?

237
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,360
Why are you crying again?

238
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,360
What's wrong?

239
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
I can't control myself.

240
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,240
I'm so silly.

241
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm so silly.

242
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,200
Rangrang won't like me anymore.

243
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,400
That's not true.

244
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,680
You don't even kiss me.

245
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,920
You don't love me.

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,560
You don't like me anymore.

247
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,400
You don't even kiss, hug,

248
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,560
or lift me up.

249
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,760
Call me hubby again.

250
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,560
Hubby.

251
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Rangrang, I love you so much.

252
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,560
I know.

253
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,680
Next, please welcome

254
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,000
our beautiful and graceful bride!

255
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,960
ZHANG LURANG, SU ZAIZAI

256
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,359
I bet your brother

257
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,880
wasn't this nervous about the NCEE.

258
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,520
I didn't want to cry,

259
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,160
but I couldn't help it.

260
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,560
My makeup is running.

261
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,480
It's okay.

262
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,160
I'm entrusting my daughter

263
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,280
to you.

264
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,200
Bride and groom, do you have anything

265
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,760
you would like to say to each other?

266
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,480
Starting from when I was 16,

267
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,920
my New Year's wish every year

268
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,560
was to marry you.

269
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,480
It seems

270
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,360
that making the same wish many times

271
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,560
will make it come true.

272
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,520
I'm honored.

273
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,000
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

274
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,920
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

275
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,400
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

276
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,240
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

277
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,600
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

278
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,120
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

279
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,280
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

280
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,000
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

281
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,960
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

282
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,040
<i>June 17th,</i>

283
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,680
<i>early summer.</i>

284
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,640
<i>Today, I finally married Zhang Lurang.</i>

285
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,240
<i>No, it's that he has finally married me.</i>

286
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,680
<i>Today should be my most unforgettable day.</i>

287
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,880
<i>That's not right either.</i>

288
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,840
<i>There were many unforgettable days</i>

289
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,880
<i>in my youth.</i>

290
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,600
<i>The starlight and the cicadas</i>

291
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,840
<i>on the day we stood guard</i>

292
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,280
<i>at the military training base,</i>

293
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,000
<i>the light that fell on us</i>

294
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,600
<i>during the play,</i>

295
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,960
<i>the train that escaped doomsday,</i>

296
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,400
<i>the sunset we watched together
in Baichuan,</i>

297
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,480
<i>partying at a music festival</i>

298
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,680
<i>with a big crowd,</i>

299
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,160
<i>the first snow</i>

300
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,440
<i>that falls every year,</i>

301
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,480
<i>and the goodbyes at sunrise.</i>

302
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,840
<i>We cried,</i>

303
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,000
<i>laughed,</i>

304
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,480
<i>parted,</i>

305
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,720
<i>and met again.</i>

306

<i>The charm of youth</i>

307
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,160
{\an8}<i>is never about getting what you want,</i>

308
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,760
<i>but about every unexpected tomorrow</i>

309
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,720
-You're all so fast.
<i>-and every person you meet by chance.</i>

310
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,680
<i>I wonder when this young boy</i>

311
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,040
<i>who exchanged a quick glance with me</i>

312
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,320
<i>under the eaves</i>

<i>-with the people I have known</i>
-Three, two,

316
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,320
<i>-since I was young.</i>
-one!

317
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,000
What are you blushing about?

318
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,000
Why are you blushing?

319
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,240
Go!

320
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,920
<i>-Congratulations on your wedding!
-The story began in the summer of 2012,</i>

321
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,960

322
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
<i>Our robust youth</i>

323
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
<i>-may make a comeback

<i>sometime in the future.</i>

325
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,760
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

326
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,960
<i>Even if we will no longer be young then</i>

327
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,480
<i>and the sun has set,</i>

328
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,120
<i>-our love will remain the same.</i>
-Smile!

329
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,720
<i>-Your heart will still race</i>
-What are you waiting for?

330
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,760
<i>when I fly towards you.</i>

331
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,280
Go to sleep.

332
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,520
Rangrang, what time are you leaving
for your business trip?

333
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,720
Seven in the morning,

334
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,760
so I can't wake you up.

335
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,320
Sleep early.

336
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,800
Come and sleep beside me.

337
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,480
I've got it.

338
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Let's sleep.

339
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,840
Rangrang, I have a question for you.

340
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,880
What?

341
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,880
If one thing is to be taken away from you,

342
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,800
would you choose to keep me

343
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,800
or your handsome face?

344
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,800
You.

345
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
What if it is between me and your height?

346
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,080
You.

347
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,640
What if it is between me and money?

348
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,200
Why are you asking me this?

349
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,200
Rangrang, you hesitated.

350
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,880
You wanted to choose money!

351
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,960
You prefer money over me!

352
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,280
I'll give you all my money then.

353
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,800
I will always choose you.

354
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,720
But Rangrang,

355
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,200
you won't be tall, rich,
or handsome anymore.

356
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,120
I might not be fond of you anymore.

357
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,440
Are you afraid of that?

358
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,720
I thought you said
only one thing would be taken.

359
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,680
Who knows what might happen?

360
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm not afraid.

361
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,920
Why?

362
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,080
There is no reason.

363
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,920
You're just sure that I love you.

364
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,440
What are you watching?

365
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,640
A fantasy movie.

366
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,840
Hey, Rangrang.

367
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,080
If you could travel back in time,

368
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,880
is there anything
that you really want to do?

369
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,800
I don't know.

370
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,440
How can you not know?

371
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,960
Is there nothing you really want to do?

372
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,400
Only those who have regrets
want to go back in time.

373
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,960
But I don't have any.

374
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,760
I had a good past

375
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,160
and I have a wonderful present.

376
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,600
What about you?

377
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,640
Is there anything you want to do?

378
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,000
I want to kiss.

379
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,800
You don't have to "want."

380
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,880
You can just kiss me.

381
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,920
Rangrang, where are you?

382
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,880
<i>I just got off work.</i>

383
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,200
<i>I'm on my way to your office.</i>

384
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,360
I'm not at my office.

385
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,120
I took this afternoon off.

386
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,760
Can you pick me up

387
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,360
at Changfeng Street near our home?

388
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,320
<i>Sure. I'll be there in five minutes.</i>

389
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,400
Rangrang.

390
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,560
Where did you go with your afternoon off?

391
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,280
The hospital.

392
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,560
The hospital?

393
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,560
What's wrong?

394
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,480
You...

395
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,320
Don't scare me.

396
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,920
What is going on?

397
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,120
I'm pregnant.

398
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,080
I said that we are going to have a baby.

399
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,360
What kind of reaction is this?

400
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,840
I have dreamed about this

401
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
so many times.

402
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,840
Thank you.

403
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,760
Rangrang, you are going

404
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,480
to have to make money

405
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,160
to buy milk powder for Youyou.

406
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,120
Youyou?

407
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,240
It's the name I came up with for our baby.

408
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,280
What do you think?

409
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,840
It sounds great.

410
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,600
Zaizai,

411
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,840
{\an8}I heard you took the afternoon off.

412
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,760
Why? Are you going home
to look after your baby?

413
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,440
Youyou is with my parents.

414
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,960
I'm going back
to my high school for a reunion.

415
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,760
What are you taking with you?

416
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,200
Our school uniform.

417
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,320
We agreed to show up wearing it.

418
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,560
Rangrang.

419
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,200
Are you here already?

420
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,640
I'll come out right away.

421
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,760
I'm leaving. Bye.

422
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,960
-Bye.
-Bye.

423
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,080
Rangrang.

424
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,440
{\an8}<i>If fate could have told me in advance</i>

425
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,000
{\an8}<i>that I would meet such a person,</i>

426
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,880
<i>could I have chosen</i>

427
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,520
<i>to meet her a little earlier?</i>

428
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,880
<i>For a long time afterward,</i>

429
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,760
<i>I thought of that scene</i>

430
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,440
<i>over and over again.</i>

431
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,000
<i>She stood under the eaves</i>

432
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,480
<i>with her extraordinarily bright eyes</i>

433
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,080
<i>looking at me through the rain.</i>

434
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,840
<i>That glance</i>

435
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,080
<i>seemed to hint at me</i>

436
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,800
<i>that my light has come.</i>

437
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,080
<i>It was that glance,</i>

438
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,600
<i>just that quick glance,</i>

439
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,080
<i>that brought us together for life</i>

440
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,240
<i>so precisely.</i>
