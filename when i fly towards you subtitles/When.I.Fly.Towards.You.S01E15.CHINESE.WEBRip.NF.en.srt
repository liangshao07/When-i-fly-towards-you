00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

3
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,040
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

4
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,080
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,120
<i>Something That Only I Don't Know About.</i>

6
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Thank you!

7
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,960
Okay, next is the intermission.

8
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to add a simple interaction, okay?

9
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,040
-Okay!
-How is this?

10
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,240
I will select a lucky member

11
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,880
from the audience
to come on stage and sing us a song.

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
-Okay!
-Sure!

13
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,120
Okay, I see that each of you

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,400
has a number card.

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,240
So I'm going to pick a number randomly.

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,360
The one who is called
will sing a song on stage.

17
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,280
Okay?

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,560
-Yes.
-Yes.

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,120
Okay. Which number should I choose?

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,760
Let's go with my lucky number, 49.

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,400
Who is holding number 49?

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,600
My number is so close.

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,800
Rangrang, it's you.

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
Gosh. It really is you.

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,880
You should try your luck on the lottery.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,280
Raise your hand quickly.

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,920
Do you want to sing? You can take this.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,520
I can tell Gu Ran can't carry a tune.

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,160
Zhang Lurang, are you not going?

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,360
Rangrang, I've never heard you sing.

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,200
I thought I could hear you sing today.

32
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,680
I don't know what song to sing though.

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,960
So you agree to do it.

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,280
Number 49 is over here!

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,280
Lucky number 49, please come up on stage.

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes!

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,480
Go for it!

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,760
Yes!

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,480
<i>The Code of Hammurabi
Enacted by an ancient Babylonian king</i>

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,480
<i>Was inscribed on a black basalt</i>

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,640
<i>Over 3,700 years ago</i>

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,240
<i>You stand in front of the showcase</i>

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,400
<i>Staring at the inscription on the stele</i>

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,640
<i>But my eyes quietly fixed on your face
That I love so much</i>

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,560
<i>Priest, temple, war, bow, and arrow
Whose past do they bring forth?</i>

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,920
How beautiful!

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,440
I never get tired of looking

48
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,680
at the sea here.

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,480
The best part is it's free!

50
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,320
Why aren't you excited about the beach?
What's wrong?

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,800
I know.

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,280
Zaizai was recording

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,560
while Zhang Lurang was singing.

54
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,240
So how did it turn out?

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,120
<i>This is so cool!</i>

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,640
We were too excited.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,480
But I meant it.

58
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,240
Well,

59
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,200
let's change the topic.

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,560
We shouldn't just be chatting

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,120
when we come to the beach.

62
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
What should we do then?

63
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,800
Well?

64
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,080
-Guan Fang, I just bought this outfit!
-Isn't this fun?

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,120
Jiangjiang, I'll help you.

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,680
-Gu Ran.
-Is this a declaration of war?

67
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,080
Come on! Take your shoes off!

68
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,480
We've been sunbathing for so long.

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,960
Our clothes should be dry by now.

70
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,800
We should enjoy ourselves to the fullest.

71
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,880
But aren't you crossing the line

72
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,400
by holding someone underwater?

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,160
This feels so nice.

74
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,520
It feels like the breeze
is blowing all my worries away.

75
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,720
It's the taste of summer.

76
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,920
Speaking of summer,

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
I think of

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,080
the summer sleeping mat on the balcony

79
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,760
and my grandma's mung bean soup.

80
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,480
For me,

81
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,680
it's sitting in an air-conditioned room

82
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,080
holding half a watermelon

83
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,040
and scooping from the very center.

84
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,040
In my mind, it's the moment

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,640
when I splash cool water on my face

86
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,400
after playing basketball.

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,000
It's so refreshing.

88
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,160
I bet you have a strong body odor.

89
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,200
Body odor?

90
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,200
Yes.

91
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,400
Is there?

92
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,520
Yes.

93
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,040
What about you, Zhang Lurang?

94
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
What comes to mind
when you think of summer?

95
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,400
The banana-flavored popsicles
that can be split into two.

96
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,800
I like eating that too.

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,000
My grandma makes
delicious banana-flavored shaved ice.

98
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,400
Let's have that when we get back.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
How I wish

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,520
this summer could go by more slowly!

101
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,800
We'll return next summer!

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,920
And the summers when we're 18,

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,600
19,

104
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,240
and all the years to come!

105
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,800
But I still like this summer

106
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,480
most of all!

107
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,640
{\an8}THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL
AFFILIATED TO JIANGYI UNIVERSITY

108
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,760
It was a close call.

109
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,640
I almost got placed in Class 5.

110
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,400
Luckily, I pulled through

111
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,040
and passed the minimum score threshold.

112
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
We're fated to be in the same class.

113
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,720
We can't escape it.

114
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,320
But I noticed that most of our classmates

115
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
are from our Class 9.

116
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,800
He Yu. Fu Yao.

117
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,080
This is great. You're here too.

118
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,920
Wang Nan is in this class too.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,720
He's fetching teaching materials
from the office.

120
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,240
Sit.

121
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,560
A few people still aren't here yet.

122
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,960
I wonder if we'll have any cute guys
in our class.

123
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Zaizai, look.

124
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,560
WELCOME, NEW STUDENTS!

125
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,800
Guan Fang?

126
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,240
Did you choose liberal arts too?

127
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,520
With my reserved

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,200
and cultured demeanor,

129
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,440
it would be a shame not to.

130
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,760
I know.

131
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,360
I do look like a science whiz.

132
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,840
It's normal for you to be surprised.

133
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,680
No, we're not.

134
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,039
First of all,
welcome to Liberal Arts Class 2.

135
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,480
I see many new faces.

136
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,120
Of course, I've met some of you

137
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,840
last year.

138
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,520
I'll introduce myself again.

139
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,080
My name is Lin Mao. I teach math.

140
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,280
From today on,
I'll be your homeroom teacher.

141
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,800
Before we start the class,

142
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
I have to inform you of something.

143
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,440
Grade 11 is a watershed in high school.

144
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,040
I hope you make good use
of your evening self-study

145
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,200
to work on your weaknesses

146
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,440
and build a strong foundation
for Grade 12.

147
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,320
Okay.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
Let's get started.

149
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,640
Let's look at the vocabulary

150
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,840
in the first chapter.

151
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,320
It feels like something is missing
with Guan Fang gone.

152
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,880
Lurang.

153
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,440
You're all I have now.

154
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,600
Gu Ran.

155
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,120
Are you bothering Zhang Lurang

156
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,560
now that Guan Fang is in liberal arts?

157
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,280
If you're bored,

158
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
you can sit by the podium.

159
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,520
I'll talk with you.

160
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,480
Okay, let's continue.

161
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,440
Don't laugh.

162
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,200
Guan Fang!

163
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,080
What brings you here?

164
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,720
We came to check on him.

165
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,840
He's so delicate. What if you bully him?

166
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,720
Is he delicate?

167
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,120
Do you have amnesia?

168
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,920
I knew it.

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,080
A mere wall

170
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,720
is no obstacle for us.

171
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,600
These are the main points
and example problems

172
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,600
from the first math chapter.

173
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,840
I sorted them out during the summer break.

174
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,160
{\an8}You can go over it

175
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,440
{\an8}during the evening self-study.

176
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
{\an8}Did you prepare this specifically for me?

177
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,720
I was doing it anyway.

178
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,320
I see.

179
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,400
Enough.

180
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,480
Let's go somewhere tomorrow afternoon.

181
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,480
No.

182
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
You don't even know where we're going.

183
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,160
I know you must be up to no good.

184
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,720
I'm not going wherever it is.

185
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,680
Are you sure?

186
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,840
I'm absolutely sure.

187
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,800
Fine.

188
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,600
Qianyu said he sent us presents.

189
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,400
I thought we could pick it up tomorrow.

190
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
But someone doesn't want to go.

191
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,080
Count me in.

192
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,560
I won't turn down a present.

193
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,840
Are you two sure you're here for me?

194
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,240
GUAN'S DESSERT SHOP

195
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,920
This is heavy. Gu Ran, open it.

196
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,280
Let me see.

197
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,160
It's for Guan Fang.

198
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,360
Transformers!

199
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,280
I must be dreaming!

200
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,560
This is mine.

201
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,840
This is for Su Zaizai.

202
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,160
This is for Lurang.

203
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,400
Maybe the presents

204
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,840
were shipped separately.

205
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,840
Don't worry.

206
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,080
That's right.

207
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,240
Your present must be precious.

208
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,040
That's why it was sent in its own parcel.

209
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,000
It must be arriving soon.

210
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,680
<i>Qianyu, are you there?</i>

211
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,160
QIANYU

212
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,760
<i>What's up? Did you receive the presents?</i>

213
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,320
<i>Was anything damaged?</i>

214
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
<i>No.</i>

215
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
<i>We all like them very much.</i>

216
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,760
<i>But Jiang Jia hasn't received hers yet.</i>

217
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,480
<i>There have been many lost parcels lately.</i>

218
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,000
<i>I'll go and check tomorrow.</i>

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,160
<i>As for Jiang Jia,</i>

220
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,680
<i>I didn't know what to buy for her.</i>

221
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,240
<i>Can you help me buy one for her?</i>

222
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,600
<i>Tell me immediately
once my present arrives.</i>

223
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,600
<i>You have a bad memory.</i>

224
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,400
<i>You'll surely forget
if I don't remind you.</i>

225
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,640
QIANYU: CAN YOU HELP ME
BUY ONE FOR HER?

226
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,840
What should I buy?

227
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,920
Excuse me.

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
Can you wrap this up nicely?

229
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,880
Is it for a girl?

230
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,640
No worries. I'll wrap it nicely.

231
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,640
How should I tell her?

232
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,160
Well,

233
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,120
Qianyu asked me to buy this for you.

234
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
That won't do.

235
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,240
Although I bought this present for you,

236
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,800
it's not much different from the others.

237
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,120
You got a present.

238
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,920
Don't be upset about not getting one.

239
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,960
Gu Ran.

240
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,600
Why did you ask for me?

241
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,360
It's...

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,840
Well...

243
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
It's...

244
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
Jiang Jia.

245
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,280
Has Qianyu's gift to you arrived?

246
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,800
See? I told you.

247
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,040
Yours was shipped on its own.

248
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,200
I wonder what is inside.

249
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,520
It's so beautiful.

250
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,640
Look.

251
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,040
<i>It looks really nice. Thank Qianyu for me.</i>

252
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,360
<i>Do you like it?</i>

253
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,240
<i>Of course.</i>

254
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,560
I'm coming.

255
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,120
Are you surprised that we're here?

256
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,160
No, I'm taken aback.

257
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,840
What brings you here?

258
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,920
We were supposed to meet at the library,

259
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
but you didn't show up.

260
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,840
Su Zaizai and Zhang Lurang

261
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
have found a place to study.

262
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,040
We're worried that you were home alone

263
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,320
and fell sick

264
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,920
like last time.

265
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,880
So we came.

266
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,480
I bet you couldn't find seats
at the library.

267
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,880
The reason is not important.

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,480
I'll go wash up.

269
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,160
I keep feeling like we lack something

270
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,920
that is essential for doing homework.

271
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,040
Gu Ran, do you have snacks?

272
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,160
They're in my room. Help yourself.

273
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Don't take everything.

274
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,000
Gu Ran keeps so many snacks.

275
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,319
I won't hold back.

276
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,160
QIANYU

277
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,200
<i>As for Jiang Jia,</i>

278
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,160
<i>I didn't know what to buy for her.</i>

279
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,280
<i>Can you help me buy one for her?</i>

280
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,240
<i>Are you coming back this year, Qianyu?</i>

281
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,840
<i>Probably not this year.</i>

282
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,040
<i>We'll see.</i>

283
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,840
Add the values of these two lines.

284
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,360
There is an auxiliary line in the middle.

285
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,960
You don't have to.

286
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
There's no need.

287
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,960
It won't connect.

288
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,680
I guess you do have a conscience.

289
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,960
You didn't clear me out.

290
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,160
I know I'm unbelievably handsome
after I clean up a bit.

291
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,520
But you don't have
to stare at me like that.

292
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,880
Did you buy a membership first?

293
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,040
Ten seconds left.

294
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,280
No way.

295
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,720
I'm done.

296
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay.

297
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Gu Ran, you lost.

298
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,320
What did you write?

299
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,560
It must be wrong.

300
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,240
We were only competing on speed,

301
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,520
not accuracy.

302
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,240
A bet is a bet. I have a question for you.

303
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,560
Answer me honestly.

304
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,520
Fire away.

305
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,520
Are you...

306
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,920
hiding anything important from me?

307
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,240
I like...

308
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,040
I ate that watermelon.

309
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,160
I ate the watermelon you bought yesterday.

310
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,080
What?

311
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,480
Gu Ran,

312
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,400
so it was you.

313
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,880
I didn't even get one bite.

314
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
Seriously? It's just a watermelon.

315
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,960
Guan Fang ate it too.

316
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,240
-I...
-Guan Fang.

317
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,080
I couldn't resist the temptation.

318
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,080
No, you're overreacting. Don't do that!

319
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,520
Stop moving!

320
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,520
Don't get physical.

321
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,880
Jiang Jia, where did you buy this watch?

322
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,360
It looks so nice.

323
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,000
Someone gave it to me.

324
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,440
Someone special gave it to her.

325
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,720
Special?

326
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,560
How special?

327
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,360
It's...

328
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,280
my good friend.

329
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,040
"Good friend."

330
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
Evening self-study is starting soon.

331
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,760
Where is Su Zaizai?

332
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,520
I think she went
to ask Zhang Lurang some questions.

333
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,960
I don't feel it during the day.

334
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,480
But it feels spooky

335
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,880
when the classroom is empty

336
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,240
at night.

337
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,600
For you,

338
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,720
{\an8}this should be scarier.

339
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,480
But I have you to teach me.

340
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,960
I'm not afraid of scary problems.

341
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,440
Look, I solved another one.

342
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,440
A reward.

343
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,920
Why did the power go out?

344
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,720
Maybe the circuit breaker tripped.

345
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,360
I bought them before.

346
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,480
There are still some left.

347
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Let's wait.

348
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Let me see.

349
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,880
You got one wrong again.

350
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,840
"In contraposition, if not B,

351
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,120
then not A.

352
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,480
Out of two propositions,

353
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,360
the condition
and conclusion of one proposition

354
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,680
is the negation
of the other's condition and conclusion."

355
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,800
You have to understand this logic.

356
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,160
Even in this ambiance,

357
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,000
why are you going over the problems?

358
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,960
What was that?

359
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,360
Well, speaking of contraposition,

360
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,880
I came across a trendy saying

361
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,240
on the forum a while ago.

362
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,240
The contrapositive of "I like you" is,

363
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,360
"If someone doesn't like you,

364
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,400
that person wouldn't be me," right?

365
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,800
"I like you"

366
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
isn't a proposition.

367
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Because the matter of the heart

368
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
can't be judged true or false.

369
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,280
But how can liking someone be false?

370
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,120
If we were

371
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,720
to change the subject to equal value,

372
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,840
the proposition
could be altered like this.

373
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
"If I exist,

374
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,600
my love for you exists."

375
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,480
Try to convert this to a contraposition.

376
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,080
"If I don't like you anymore,

377
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,320
then I wouldn't be me."

378
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,120
What are you talking about?

379
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,280
Is it about yesterday's blackout?

380
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,800
No, Mr. Lin just came and said

381
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
we can't have co-ed deskmates.

382
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
We have to change seats.

383
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,040
I heard from my friend in Class 6

384
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,520
that they have to change seats too.

385
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Why?

386
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,040
I know.

387
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,360
I passed by the office just now.

388
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,160
I saw the dean
and Class 3's homeroom teacher

389
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,080
in a meeting with two students.

390
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,600
As I bent down to tie my shoelaces,

391
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
I heard that these two students

392
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,440
snuck out to the school field for a stroll

393
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,160
during yesterday's evening self-study.

394
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,920
They ran into the dean,
who was also out for a walk.

395
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,280
And when that happened,

396
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,920
they were holding hands.

397
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,080
Could it be...

398
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,960
No wonder the school started
cracking down on this.

399
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,520
So it has happened already.

400
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,160
You take so long to tie shoelaces.

401
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,960
Is that important?

402
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,520
The point is how the school handles this.

403
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,560
I think

404
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,880
the teachers will inform us
in the afternoon.

405
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,920
<i>Before class starts,</i>

406
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,200
I have something to brief you on a matter.

407
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,040
Evening self-study sessions
just started recently

408
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,200
and there have already been
close interactions between boys and girls.

409
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,760
The school takes this very seriously.

410
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,160
I hope you can

411
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,000
put your focus on what truly matters.

412
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,200
Evening self-study is provided

413
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,680
to help you study.

414
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,080
Don't exploit this period

415
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,600
for something inappropriate.

416
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,000
Of course,

417
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,600
I believe you all

418
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,080
prioritize your studies.

419
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,200
But please be alert.

420
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Report to me if you notice anything.

421
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,400
Do you all understand?

422
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,840
-Understood.
-Understood.

423
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,960
Good.

424
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,240
Let's continue.

425
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,800
Rangrang,

426
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,480
you're up to 70% accuracy now.

427
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,480
Well done.

428
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,400
Hello.

429
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,640
I just left
from asking Ms. Zhang questions.

430
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,120
I'm coming down now. Wait for me.

431
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,000
Why are there people
in the club room at night?

432
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,960
Hurry up.

433
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,880
Here.

434
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,680
You're so slow.

435
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,680
Look at this.

436
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,160
Three moves.

437
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,440
You're going to lose in three moves.
Think carefully.

438
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,600
Here.

439
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,280
-Watch.
-Su Zaizai.

440
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,360
Mr. Lin wants you to go to the office now.

441
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
Three moves.

442
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,320
-I'll give you three moves.
-Okay.

443
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,560
Bring it on. Five.

444
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,280
Here.

445
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,560
Mr. Lin.

446
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,680
Come in.

447
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,840
Mr. Lin, you tell her.

448
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,800
Okay.

449
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,400
Well, we asked for you because...

450
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,680
Don't beat around the bush.

451
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,640
Let me do it.

452
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,280
Have you two been close lately?

453
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,280
Yes.

454
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,040
You're still young.

455
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,480
Placement tests are in two months.

456
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,640
Every second in high school is crucial.

457
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,240
Don't waste your time on other things.

458
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,760
Ms. Zhang,

459
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,200
it's not what you think.

460
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,360
What do you mean?

461
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,000
We have a photo of you two.

462
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,080
{\an8}Hurry up.

463
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,800
Look at this. Explain it.

464
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,480
We were going over problems.

465
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,200
Did you have to do that

466
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,080
in an empty classroom?

467
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,760
Someone has reported this to us.

468
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,680
What does this mean?

469
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,560
It means
that your behavior has affected others.

470
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,240
Well, Mr. Chang,

471
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,560
it's not that serious.

472
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,240
These two tutor each other.

473
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,560
We all know that.

474
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,400
Maybe those who aren't aware of this

475
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,320
had a misunderstanding

476
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,480
and took this photo.

477
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Right?

478
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,520
You.

479
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,960
Why are you nodding?

480
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,320
Listen, Su Zaizai.

481
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,360
Su Zaizai.

482
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,960
Ms. Zhang told me

483
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,840
that you're joining

484
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,080
an English recitation competition.

485
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,440
And Zhang Lurang

486
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,320
is joining a physics competition.

487
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,760
You're all grown up.

488
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,880
We shouldn't waste our time.

489
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,080
Am I right?

490
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,680
You've grown up and are big kids now.

491
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,440
I'm sure you know what is important.

492
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
We must place our time and energy

493
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,680
on preparing for the competitions.

494
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,600
I can win first place
even without preparing.

495
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,840
Me too.

496
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,400
What...

497
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,040
Look at them.

498
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,960
Mr. Chang,

499
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,240
if you call us here

500
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,200
but refuse to believe what we say,

501
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,840
did you bring us here just to accuse us?

502
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,120
Su Zaizai.

503
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,120
Forget it.

504
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,040
You can go back.

505
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,760
Mind your behavior from now on.

506
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,120
You may go.

507
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,240
You must win first place.

508
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,280
Don't mind them, Mr. Chang.

509
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,360
The teachers have found out about you two.

510
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,600
Do you still plan to bug him?

511
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,920
So you told on us.

512
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,480
Yes. So what?

513
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,800
I told the truth.

514
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,920
How can you be such an idiot?

515
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,600
I really can't stand you.

516
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,600
Do you like Zhang Lurang?

517
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,040
So why are you trying to get my attention?

518
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,320
What nonsense are you saying?

519
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,720
Just drop it, will you?

520
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,120
You only look dumber by doing this.

521
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,600
By the way,

522
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,240
here's a heads-up for you.

523
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,400
I will let Zhang Lurang know

524
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,280
that it was you who told the teacher.

525
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,680
Go ahead and cry.

526
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,640
After you cry it out,

527
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,440
be a better person.

528
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,720
You...

529
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
This kind of thing

530
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,960
had better not happen again.

531
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,400
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL
AFFILIATED TO JIANGYI UNIVERSITY

532
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,680
I heard a parent came here

533
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,040
because a student is dating.

534
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
The boy is even in an honors class.

535
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,840
How daring.

536
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,440
I'm not griping.

537
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,640
Perfect timing, Lurang. Come here.

538
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,600
Mom, what are you doing here?

539
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,600
If I didn't come,

540
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,160
I wouldn't have known
what you were up to at school.

541
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,480
Your homeroom teacher
called me last night.

542
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,960
She said you've been getting close

543
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,800
with a girl in another class lately.

544
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,760
You...

545
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,000
It's not that serious.

546
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,640
They're just tutoring each other.

547
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,320
And you know about it, don't you?

548
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,560
He should focus on his studies at his age.

549
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,760
I'm not asking you
to be as excellent as your brother.

550
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,240
But you should at least not make us worry.

551
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,520
By the way,

552
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,320
didn't you come to see me

553
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,360
for something else?

554
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,640
Yes.

555
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,160
I got so mad at him that I forgot.

556
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,120
I came here to ask you

557
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,440
about Lurang's school transfer.

558
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,400
What documents are needed?
Talking in person is...

559
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,120
Transfer? What transfer?

560
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,040
I've discussed this with your dad.

561
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,560
You're transferring back to Suyang.

562
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,440
-It's...
-I'll take the NCEE in Jiangyi.

563
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,360
Take the NCEE in Jiangyi?

564
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Your uncle doesn't have
much time to look after you.

565
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,560
Could you get into any good university?

566
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,040
Lurang,

567
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
class is starting soon.

568
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,280
Go back to the classroom.

569
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,480
Give that to me. Put the homework down.

570
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,400
Go now.

571
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,720
Why are you looking at me?

572
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,400
Look at him. How can I be at ease?

573
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Why are you so mad? Sit.

574
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,600
Stop taking his side.

575
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,000
It's not a serious problem.

576
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,480
Lurang, regarding the NCEE...

577
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,600
Uncle, can I stay in Jiangyi for the NCEE?

578
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,680
You don't have to take care of me.

579
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,000
I'll move into the school dorm.

580
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,800
That's not the reason you have to go back.

581
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,400
Your student registration is in Suyang,

582
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,080
so you have to take the NCEE there.

583
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,920
Actually, your mom was right.

584
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,880
The Suyang school has honor classes
for both science and the arts.

585
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,920
If you go back too late,

586
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,320
you won't get into an honors class.

587
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
After all,
the two schools' curriculums differ.

588
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,160
You will more or less be affected.

589
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,760
If you're taking the exam somewhere else,

590
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,680
you need to prepare many documents.

591
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,400
If you insist on staying,

592
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,800
I'll try to figure something out.

593
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,120
Okay.

594
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,640
There is still some time.

595
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,320
Don't worry too much about it.

596
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,280
Rest early.

597
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,440
SU ZAIZAI

598
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,440
NEVER MIND. I'LL CONTINUE
DOING HOMEWORK. IT'S NEVER-ENDING!

599
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,280
Rangrang.

600
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,840
I bet that you hadn't left,
so I waited here for you.

601
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,960
I think I've gotten used to commuting

602
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,199
to and from school with you.

603
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,320
Something feels missing when I'm alone.

604
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,920
Rangrang,

605
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,280
is something on your mind?

606
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,640
Is it because someone reported us?

607
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,880
If possible,

608
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,760
can you talk to me about it?

609
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,960
I haven't decided yet.

610
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,360
Then come to me when you want to talk.

611
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,560
I can tell you some jokes.

612
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,920
I was talking to a girl from my class

613
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,480
in the hallway just now.

614
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,080
The dean saw us and kept staring at me.

615
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,680
Is that necessary?

616
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,520
Beats me.

617
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,040
They're so strict on this now.

618
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,960
Zhang Lurang from the honors class

619
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,800
gets such good grades.

620
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,720
A girl from another class
keeps pestering him.

621
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,720
What bad luck.

622
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,160
I bet he must be annoyed.

623
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,120
{\an8}SCHOOL TRANSFER APPLICATION

624
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,400
-Let me help you.
-No, thank you.

625
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,440
I saw you in the office

626
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,800
when I handed in homework earlier today.

627
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,000
Were you and Mr. Lin talking

628
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,920
about the academic competition?

629
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,160
No.

630
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,560
<i>Before you transfer,</i>

631
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,520
you need to fill out this application.

632
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,800
Fill this out.

633
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,160
As for the rest of the procedures,
your mom will handle it.

634
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,120
By the way,

635
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,200
there are a few months left.

636
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,760
{\an8}Have you told Gu Ran and others?

637
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,400
Not yet.

638
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,840
You should tell them soon.

639
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,160
Give them time to process it.

SCHOOL TRANSFER APPLICATION

641
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,560
Whenever I'm down,

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,600
food can always cheer me up.

643
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
Guan Fang said

644
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,760
his grandma recently made a tasty dish.

645
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,000
Su Zaizai, be quiet.

646
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,960
I'm sorry.

647
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,400
I...

648
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,000
You've arrived home. I'll get going.

649
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480

No, thank you.

652
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,200
Su Zaizai, be quiet.
