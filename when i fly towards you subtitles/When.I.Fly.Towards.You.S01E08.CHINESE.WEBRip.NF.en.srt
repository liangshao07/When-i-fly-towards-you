-Kiss!

5
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,360
<i>Hey, My Prince.</i>

6
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
Mr. Lin, did you ask to see me?

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,080
Su Zaizai.

8
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,280
You can tell me
if I've done anything wrong.

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,200
I'll do better.

10
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,400
Has Rangrang caused you any trouble

11
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,120
while you were tutoring him?

12
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,680
No, he hasn't.

13
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,160
He has also tutored me.

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,080
I'm the one that troubles him.

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,360
To be honest,

16
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,960
English has always been his weakness.

17
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,160
He has scored poorly in it

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,600
since middle school.

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,040
His parents have always been worried
about this.

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,040
Your tutoring
has been quite effective for him.

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,800
There has been a marked improvement

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,920
in his grades lately.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
Thank you.

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,120
It was Rangrang...

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,880
Zhang Lurang is smart.

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,080
He's a quick learner.

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,520
{\an8}I'm saying this as Lurang's uncle.

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,520
{\an8}I have to thank you.

29
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,000
By the way,

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,360
if you have any math questions,

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,520
you can ask me at any time.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,120
Of course, you can ask Lurang too.

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,200
Okay.

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,120
I'll definitely ask you
if I have any questions.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,480
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,240
GRADE 10, CLASS 9

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,800
-Let's go. Bye.
-Bye.

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,040
Hey, Zaizai.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,960
Why did Mr. Lin
want to see you during the break?

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,360
It was about tutoring Zhang Lurang.

41
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,880
I thought he was going to scold us

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,920
for messing around.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,840
But instead,

44
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,120
he thanked me.

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,480
He is quite happy
about Zhang Lurang's improved English.

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,120
Mr. Lin is really good to Zhang Lurang.

47
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,640
He does.

48
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,720
It would be great
if I had an uncle like that.

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,520
Jiangjiang,
I'm not leaving with you today.

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,960
-I still...
-I know.

51
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,400
Tutoring.

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,640
Your joy is all over your face.

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,640
-Go quickly.
-You can leave with Gu Ran.

54
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,000
No, thank you.

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,360
Go on now.

56
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,280
There is something on your skirt.

57
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,360
Hey.

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,720
Do you have any?

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,040
I only have this.

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

61
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Why are there still so many people around?

62
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,640
Gu Ran!

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,840
What's up?

64
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,840
Just say it. Don't be awkward.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,560
Are you about to head home?

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,600
Can you give me a ride?

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,440
No, I'm going to play basketball.

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,760
Wait here for me for a bit.

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,640
It'll be late when he's done playing.

70
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,040
Forget it. What do I expect from him?

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
Jiang Jia?

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,600
Qianyu?

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,200
What's wrong?

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,480
I...

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,600
Well...

76
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,400
I have a leg cramp.

77
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,080
No, it's my stomach.

78
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,040
What am I saying?

79
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,320
Where do you live?

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,680
I'll give you a ride home.

81
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,320
Qianyu,

82
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,120
will it be too much trouble
for you to give me a ride home?

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
It's okay. I live in that area too.

84
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,760
It's on the way.

85
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,160
Tomorrow is
the school anniversary performance.

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,720
Will you be okay to do it?

87
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
Yes.

88
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,360
I'm feeling a lot better now.

89
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,840
Then do your best tomorrow.

90
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
Okay, let's both do our best.

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,000
Are you taking pictures of the sunset?

92
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes.

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,760
Today's sunset is beautiful.

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,160
What's the matter?

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,160
It's okay.

96
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,560
You can finish taking pictures.

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,520
This is the most beautiful sunset

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,640
I've ever seen.

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,080
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL
AFFILIATED TO JIANGYI UNIVERSITY

100
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Today, we gather here

101
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,840
to celebrate the 60th anniversary

102
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,200
of The First High School.

103
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,840
Today, with great excitement,

104
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,680
we reminisce about the fast growth

105
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
of The First High School.

106
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,920
What's our queue number?

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,400
The fifth.

108
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,680
Be quiet. I'm going through my lines.

109
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,320
Where is Su Zaizai?

110
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,880
She just went to get changed.

111
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,920
Her hairstyle is a little complicated.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,960
But she should be...

113
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,960
Gosh.

114
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,200
It looks so real.

115
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,960
You do look like Cinderella.

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,960
Stop talking nonsense.

117
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,760
Next time, I'll let you play Cinderella.

118
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,240
Actually, I think it looks pretty.

119
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,880
-It is pretty.
-Let Qianyu see it too.

120
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,400
Where is Qianyu?

121
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,800
I don't know.

122
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,560
I don't think I have seen him today.

123
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,840
We're about to go on.
Don't tell me he's not here yet.

124
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,400
Don't worry. I'll look for him.

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
Relax.

126
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,280
Recite your lines in your head.

127
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,880
Come on, everyone.

128
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,520
Is Qianyu injured?

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,960
What exactly happened?

130
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,360
I searched everywhere
but couldn't find him.

131
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,280
I finally reached him
after several phone calls.

132
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,400
Qianyu fell off his bike

133
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,440
on his way to school.

134
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,640
He's at the hospital now.

135
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,960
-He probably can't make it.
-Is it serious?

136
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,520
Don't worry.

137
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,560
He's fine.

138
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,600
Now we should be worried
about our performance.

139
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,800
What should we do?

140
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,120
<i>Coming next is the fashion show,</i>
Era of Painted Impressions.

141
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,400
<i>Please get ready.</i>

142
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,840
We didn't pick a backup prince.

143
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,400
Even if we manage to find someone,

144
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,040
he won't have time to memorize the lines.

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,920
Zhang Lurang,

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
can you go on stage?

147
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,360
-Me?
-That's right.

148
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,000
Why didn't I think of it?

149
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,120
Lurang knows the lines.

150
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,440
Lurang,

151
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
you must not back down.

152
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,880
You must go on stage.

153
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
I have confidence in you.

154
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,000
You can do it.

155
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,920
Lurang,

156
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
I told my grandma.

157
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
I don't want
to miss the chance to go on stage.

158
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,640
That's right.

159
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,960
We've practiced for so long.

160
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,560
Help us out, please.

161
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,240
Help me out too, please.

162
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,520
Okay.

163
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,679
I'll try.

164
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,120
Rangrang, don't be nervous.

165
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,080
Just do as we usually rehearsed.

166
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,920
Are you nervous?

167
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,240
No, I'm not.

168
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,800
Just admit that you're nervous.

169
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,040
What's the big deal anyway?

170
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,200
I won't laugh at you.

171
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,240
Actually,

172
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,520
I'm a little nervous.

173
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Are you really nervous?

174
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
I guarantee you won't be nervous
with my method.

175
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,760
When you go on stage later,

176
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,280
just imagine the audience as cabbages.

177
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,000
Cabbages?

178
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,920
Yes.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,360
What is there to be nervous about
in front of cabbages?

180
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,320
Am I right?

181
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,360
And even if you make a mistake,

182
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,160
what does it matter
when it's for cabbages?

183
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,440
But you still have to be a little nervous.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,840
After all,

185
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,080
a handsome cabbage like me

186
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,560
is sitting in the audience.

187
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,080
You're too self-absorbed.

188
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,480
Are you still nervous now?

189
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,960
Well, not really.

190
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,400
<i>The fashion show segment</i>

191
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,120
<i>showcasing the characteristics of the era</i>

192
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,440
<i>was truly memorable.</i>

193
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,680
<i>But the excitement doesn't end here.</i>

194
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,920
It's our turn to go on stage.

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,920
Break a leg.

196
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,400
All the best.

197
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,320
Let's do this.

198
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,520
Coming up next,

199
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,960
please enjoy
the classic theater adaptation

200
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
of <i>Cinderella</i>

201
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
presented by the Drama Club.

202
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,520
<i>A long time ago,</i>

203
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,000
<i>there lived a beautiful girl</i>

204
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,320
<i>named Cinderella.</i>

205
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,480
<i>Although her father had left her,</i>

206
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,680
<i>her mother loved her dearly.</i>

207
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,640
<i>Until one day,</i>

208
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,680
<i>her mother married
a selfish and narrow-minded man.</i>

209
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,440
Father, who is she?

210
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,800
She's so filthy.

211
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,440
She's your stepsister.

212
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,840
Don't worry, my little princesses.

213
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,840
She can do

214
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,400
the laundry

215
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,520
and cook for you.

216
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,640
Why?

217
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,800
From today onwards,

218
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,320
you will be our servant!

219
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,360
We have a professional videographer.

220
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,000
I know.

221
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,680
I'm filming it for Guan Fang's grandma.

222
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,920
She will love this.

223
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,760
Your Highness, no girl in this house

224
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,640
can fit into the glass slipper.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,040
May I try it?

226
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,280
Didn't you say

227
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,040
you only have two daughters?

228
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,080
Your Excellency,

229
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,800
I indeed only have two daughters.

230
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,040
This filthy girl is just our servant.

231
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,840
She's dirty

232
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,160
and will ruin this beautiful shoe.

233
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,480
Take her up to the attic now!

234
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,080
The evil stepsister in the green dress

235
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,280
isn't hateful at all.

236
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,480
She's quite cute.

237
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,440
Cute?

238
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,760
Yes. Why?

239
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,120
How is she cute?

240
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,560
She even stumbles while walking.

241
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,720
She's as stubborn as a donkey.

242
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,880
How is she cute?

243
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,800
Do you know her?

244
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,480
Then introduce her to me.

245
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,680
We are not close.

246
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,560
My dear prince,

247
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,400
you're like the moon high above

248
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,240
casting a gentle light on the sea.

249
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,680
I gaze from afar

250
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,880
and everything seems so beautiful to me.

251
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,160
But the moon doesn't belong to me

252
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,520
and neither do you.

253
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,160
I used to think

254
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,520
that it was the fairy's magic

255
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,160
that turned me into a princess.

256
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,400
But now that you are standing before me,

257
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,600
I realize

258
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,520
that every girl is a princess

259
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,640
in front of the one that she loves.

260
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,920
When I fly toward the moon,

261
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,760
the moon

262
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,240
is also learning to run forward for me.

263
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,960
{\an8}It's a reward for your good performance.

264
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,960
Thank you.

265
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,760
Rangrang,

266
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,880
why do you keep avoiding looking at me?

267
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
I won't charge you for looking at me.

268
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,080
Rangrang,

269
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,320
do I look pretty today?

270
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,520
So-so.

271
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,800
You clearly think I look pretty.

272
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,520
I'll go and get changed first.

273
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,000
Hey, wait.

274
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,560
We just finished taking photos.

275
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,600
There's still film left.

276
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,960
Shall I take a photo of you two?

277
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
Yes, since you haven't changed yet.

278
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,840
It will be so memorable.

279
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,840
And they look like the real deal.

280
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,720
What's going on?

281
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,680
Well,

282
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,520
a prince and a princess.

283
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
What else could it be?

284
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,680
Hurry, the auditorium is closing soon.

285
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,560
How about that spot?

286
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,880
Ready.

287
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,480
Is there a wall between you two?

288
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,440
Get closer.

289
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,800
Okay, look at the camera. One.

290
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
Two.

291
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,320
Three.

292
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,400
Grandma.

293
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,000
You've watched it so many times.

294
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,120
Aren't you tired of it?

295
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,640
Of course not.

296
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,800
Look at how well you acted.

297
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,640
I can't have enough of this.

298
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,560
Grandma, look closely.

299
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,720
{\an8}I'm not even on stage yet at this point.

300
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,000
{\an8}Who says you're not?

301
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,760
The one who is sneaking a peek

302
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,080
from behind the red curtain.

303
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,720
Isn't this you?

304
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,280
Your eyesight

305
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,400
is even worse than an old lady like me.

306
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,600
I can't believe you spotted that.

307
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,240
You first performed on stage

308
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,040
when you were in kindergarten.

309
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,480
At that time,

310
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,640
among the 20 children

311
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,360
who were wearing identical clothes,

312
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,480
I spotted you at one glance.

313
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,640
Don't you think it's strange?

314
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,720
They tried to find you but couldn't.

315
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,080
But how did I manage to do it right away?

316
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
That's because you have sharp eyes.

317
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,160
Next time,
I'll strive to get the lead role

318
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,080
and stand right in the middle of the stage

319
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,440
to save you the trouble.

320
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,840
Do you want to be the lead?

321
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,960
To be honest,

322
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,880
it would be a lot of work.

323
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,960
Then don't be the lead.

324
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,840
It's so tiring to be the lead.

325
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,480
They have to shine brightly

326
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,400
and make sure everyone can see them.

327
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,040
You don't necessarily

328
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
have to become the sun.

329
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
If you're willing to,

330
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,400
you could be a star,

331
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,600
a streetlight,

332
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,960
or a firefly.

333
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,960
They are all capable of shining.

334
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,400
When they want to shine, they shine.

335
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
When they don't feel like shining,

336
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,760
they can slack off.

337
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,080
Even if you never shine,

338
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,080
some people

339
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,040
could still spot you at a glance.

340
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,520
Grandma, where did you learn

341
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,840
such a grand speech?

342
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,680
Who recorded this video?

343
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,800
Gu Ran.

344
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,480
You've met him several times.

345
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,599
Did he record it for someone else?

346
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,560
Why weren't you

347
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,560
in the video after this part?

348
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,000
Really?

349
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,960
Let me see.

350
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,640
I guess she does look cute.

351
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,680
Why am I watching her?

352
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,920
Are you going?

353
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,360
Yes.

354
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,200
{\an8}What a surprise.

355
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,800
{\an8}Su Zaizai

356
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,080
is so popular.

357
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,720
They must be asking
for her contact information.

358
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
After the anniversary celebration,

359
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,960
many boys gathered
at our classroom door to look at her.

360
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,680
Your Cinderella might be taken away.

361
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,640
Are you jealous?

362
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,600
Why would I be jealous?

363
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,680
That guy asked me for my WeChat today.

364
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't plan to give it to him.

365
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,160
Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

366
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,480
I want you to trust me.

367
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,000
So I have to let you know.

368
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,160
After all, I am...

369
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,600
your student.

370
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,520
Students should listen to their teachers.

371
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,920
You told me to study hard

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,040
and I will.

373
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,400
If you stay silent,

374
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,880
that means you agree with me.

375
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,400
But as your English teacher,

376
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,600
I'm not very satisfied

377
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,920
with your performance.

378
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,720
Why?

379
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,720
It's dangerous

380
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,920
when a stranger offers drinks.

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,240
What if they're a bad person?

382
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,000
What should I do then?

383
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,800
You should yell my name,

384
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,360
"Su Zaizai!"

385
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,080
Then I'll appear

386
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,360
to get you out of trouble.

387
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,280
Do you remember that?

388
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,360
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

389
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Su Zaizai.

390
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,440
I...

391
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,760
I'll try.

392
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,080
See you tomorrow.

393
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
Rangrang is becoming more adorable.

394
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,640
<i>Lurang, I heard</i>

395
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,200
<i>you're close with Su Zaizai from Class 9.</i>

396
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,000
<i>Do you have her contact information?</i>

397
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,040
<i>I want to be friends with her.</i>

398
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,240
<i>I'll treat you to a meal tomorrow.</i>

399
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,840
Contact information?

400
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,560
Then do you want to give it to him?

401
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,400
<i>I'll answer on your behalf.</i>

402
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,760
<i>No.</i>

403
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,440
<i>Rangrang, you must keep the good things</i>

404
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,760
<i>for yourself.</i>

405
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
What are you doing?

406
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,240
Passersby would think

407
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,880
{\an8}you're going in for a fight.

408
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,920
{\an8}I thought you were fearless.

409
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,840
What is so hard about entering a ward?

410
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,040
I think it's better

411
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,600
for us to go in together.

412
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,240
Are Zhang Lurang and the others
arriving soon?

413
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,640
We should wait for them.

414
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,280
<i>A car hit me</i>

415
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,880
when I was riding my bike.

416
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,520
I just need to wear a cast for a while.

417
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,760
It's nothing serious.

418
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,040
You guys are too generous.

419
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,920
These are all from Jiang Jia.

420
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,040
I told her you can't finish all of this.

421
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll share it with you.

422
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,520
Thank you.

423
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,040
My grandma made this pig's trotter soup.

424
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,160
{\an8}She said it's good for bone injuries.

425
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,000
-Okay.
-That's right.

426
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,920
Qianyu, take good care of your injury.

427
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,880
You must've been panicking at that time.

428
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Luckily, you saved the day.

429
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,240
You guys even won first prize.

430
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,240
Thank you.

431
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,240
No problem.

432
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,200
That's right, Gu Ran.

433
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,520
I might need your help with something.

434
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,480
What is it?

435
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,960
We need to return several props
to the rental place.

436
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,440
Do you have time to go tomorrow?

437
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,880
We agreed on the return time
when we rented them.

438
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,520
Okay, I'll go tomorrow.

439
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,480
Thank you.

440
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,080
Let me serve you a bowl.

441
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,080
All right.

442
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,600
Do you want to go too?

443
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,480
There are quite a lot of props.

444
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,880
I'm afraid you might lose them

445
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,160
and we'll have to pay compensation.

446
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,480
So I'll go with you despite the trouble.

447
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,440
Thank you for earlier.

448
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,240
So this is why you're going with me.

449
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,040
Why do you talk so much?

450
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,800
If I don't have to go, then forget it.

451
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,120
It's good to have an extra pair of hands.

452
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,080
Don't leave.

453
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,120
What time tomorrow?

454
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,120
Where should we meet?

455
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm almost there. Where are you?

456
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,320
<i>I think I lost my way.</i>

457
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,960
<i>I'll be there soon. One more block.</i>

458
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,280
I wonder who is the one helping out.

459
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,960
Isn't that the guy from before?

460
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,200
If Shen Qianyu were the one waiting here,

461
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,760
she would have probably come running.

462
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,600
Are you waiting for someone?

463
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,440
Do you know me?

464
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,000
Really? How forgetful of you.

465
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,200
You beat us by one point
on the basketball court

466
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,720
and embarrassed us in front of everyone.

467
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,400
Have you forgotten so quickly?

468
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,760
I remember it now.

469
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
My friend said the ball was really good.

470
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,160
Thank you. I'm busy.

471
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,120
I have to go.

472
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,760
Did I say you can go?

473
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,880
We've been wanting

474
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,240
to reclaim that ball for a long time.

475
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,560
Sorry, I don't want to play today.

476
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,080
Hold on.

477
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,400
Who asked for your opinion?

478
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,160
I said that I'm not playing.

479
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,160
Are you deaf?

480
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,680
Say that again.

481
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,560
Gu Ran.

482
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,840
Stand behind me.

483
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,280
Are you protecting me?

484
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,000
Stop talking. Just watch.

485
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,280
Are you protecting him?

486
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,960
Who are you?

487
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,240
Really?

488
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,240
Are you letting a girl fight for you?

489
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,000
You're just jealous.

490
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Me? Jealous?

491
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,280
Fine.

492
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,600
Let's do this.

493
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,520
I just got my blue belt

494
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,200
and haven't had a chance to practice.

495
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,280
Officer, they're the ones!

496
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,600
Hey!

497
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,960
Stop right there!

498
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,000
What's a blue belt?

499
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,720
It's the rank below a black belt.

500
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,360
They wouldn't believe I'm a black belt.

501
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,280
What do you think? Wasn't I convincing?

502
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,680
Actually,

503
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,560
that would be a red belt.

504
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,520
Mr. Lin,

505
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,440
you're early.

506
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
I went to buy some fruit.

507
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,360
By the way, Mr. Lin,

508
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,880
will Lurang also be competing

509
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,320
in a few days?

510
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,160
Yes, he has been studying every day.

511
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,520
He even studies on the weekends.

512
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,160
Your nephew is the most disciplined person

513
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,600
in this area.

514
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,080
Are you going to study this early?

515
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,400
No, I'm going to the aquarium.

516
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,240
It's a good work-life balance.

517
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
He also likes

518
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,080
to go out with friends to relax.

519
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,720
Boys tend to be more lively.

520
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,240
Yes, you're right.

521
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,080
-Right.
-Are you going out with Gu Ran?

522
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,400
Don't come back too late, okay?

523
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,680
Zhang Lurang.

524
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,760
Hello, Mr. Lin.

525
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,920
Su Zaizai?

526
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,760
We won't take up your time, Mr. Lin.

527
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,040
We'll get going then.

528
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,200
Why is there a girl?

529
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,880
Listen, kids these days

530
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,760
get close far too easily.

531
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,680
Mr. Lin is going to get upset now.

532
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,360
You said you're going to the aquarium.

533
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,800
You don't have to hurry home.

534
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,240
It's okay if you come home late.

535
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,000
But you must see her home first.

536
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,920
By the way,

537
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,160
the weather is getting cold.

538
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,880
When you buy drinks, get something hot.

539
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,280
Do you have money? I'll give you some.

540
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,960
It's okay.

541
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,280
Uncle, I'll get going then.

542
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,200
Okay. Go on.

543
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,800
Bye, Mr. Lin.

544
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,800
Okay, bye.

545
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,440
{\an8}These all seem to be tropical fish.

546
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,200
{\an8}-Really?
-That one is so colorful.

547
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,400
{\an8}-Rangrang.
-Yes, it's pretty.

548
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,080
{\an8}Have you never been
to the Jiangyi Aquarium before?

549
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,920
It's okay. I'm familiar with this place.

550
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,480
I can be your tour guide for free.

551
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,800
Look at that.

552
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,440
It's called

553
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,360
a doll fish.

554
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,960
It looks like a doll.

555
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,280
It's so cute.

556
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,600
Children, look at this.

557
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,000
This bright orange fish

558
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,960
with two white stripes

559
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
on its body

560
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,400
is called a clownfish.

561
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,520
Despite its name,

562
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,000
it doesn't look like a clown at all.

563
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,560
It's actually very cute.

564
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,400
Well,

565
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
I wasn't entirely wrong.

566
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,480
It does look cute.

567
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
I was half right.

568
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,320
Look at that long one over there.

569
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,000
It doesn't look like a fish at all,

570
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,480
but it's also a fish.

571
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,080
It's called a stingray.

572
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,400
That one is called a stingray

573
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,520
and looks like a devil.

574
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,680
Rangrang, look at that fish.

575
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,200
It's so pretty and cute.

576
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,680
Children, we should learn
from this young lady

577
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,840
and love marine life.

578
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,520
It's getting more attractive.

579
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,080
It's so fleshy.

580
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,000
It would be delicious
as Sichuan boiled fish.

581
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,520
The size is just right.

582
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,000
My pot at home is exactly this big.

583
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,200
Miss, this young lady wants to eat it!

584
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,040
Don't!

585
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,400
I don't plan to eat it right now.

586
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,200
She's joking with you. She can't eat it.

587
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,240
She can't eat it.

588
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,200
The young lady won't actually eat it.

589
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,960
She said that because she finds it cute

590
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,080
{\an8}and really likes it.

591
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,360
Really?

592
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,600
You're very cute too.

593
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
Rangrang,

594
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,680
I didn't know
you were so good at coaxing kids.

595
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,760
I'm not.

596
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,960
I was forced to.

597
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,200
Well,

598
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,080
can you coax a 200-month-old kid?

599
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,640
You don't have to.

600
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,000
Kids who are 200 months old are sensible.

601
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,800
<i>Rangrang!</i>

602
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
<i>Su Zaizai.</i>

603
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,680
<i>Hello.</i>

604
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,560
<i>We're currently rehearsing our lines.</i>

605
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,400
<i>Beside me is my male lead,</i>

606
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,840
<i>Prince Rangrang.</i>

607
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,280
<i>Su Zaizai,</i>

608
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,440
<i>have you memorized
the final paragraph of your lines?</i>

609
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,840
<i>I used to think</i>

610
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,160
<i>that it was the fairy's magic</i>

611
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
<i>that turned me into a princess.</i>

612
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,080
<i>It wasn't until the clock struck midnight</i>

613
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,320
<i>that I was brought back to reality.</i>

614
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,560
<i>How can I be good enough for you?</i>

615
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,840
<i>Have you forgotten your lines?</i>

616
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
<i>Rangrang,</i>

617
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,840
<i>I think I've found the reason</i>

618
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,320
<i>I always get stuck here.</i>

619
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,200
<i>What is it?</i>

620
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,520
<i>It's because I can't accept it.</i>

621
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,480
<i>I think</i>

622
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,120
<i>Cinderella thinks too little of herself.</i>

623
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,280
<i>Why isn't she</i><i>good enough for the prince?</i>

624
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,520
<i>Does only a princess deserve a prince?</i>

625
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,680
<i>I don't think so.</i>

626
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,120
<i>I want to ask Mr. Xiao
to change the script.</i>

627
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,040
<i>Rangrang, how should we change it?</i>

628
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,840
<i>Maybe we can change it to this.</i>

629
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
<i>Perhaps every girl</i>

630
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,880
<i>can become a princess</i>

631
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,040
<i>in front of the one that she loves.</i>

632
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,320
<i>Sixteen-year-old girls seem to be able</i>

633
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,720
<i>to constantly immerse themselves</i>

634
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,040
<i>in novels and movies,</i>

635
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
<i>making it their sweet and lovely secret.</i>
