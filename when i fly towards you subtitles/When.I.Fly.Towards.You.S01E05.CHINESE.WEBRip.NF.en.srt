00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,960
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

4
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,960
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,640
<i>Those Moments I Have Never Regretted.</i>

6
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,200
Bye.

7
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
How was it?

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
Wasn't I cool?

9
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,240
Yes.

10
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,200
Did you hear that?

11
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,720
Cool!

12
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
-Nice!
-Let's take a break.

13
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,120
Why is she still here?

14
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,960
I shouldn't have been so charismatic.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,040
What did you say?

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Come here.

17
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
Look.

18
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,720
She's looking this way again.

19
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,760
There are so many people here.

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,760
This is embarrassing.

21
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,160
Why do I feel

22
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,480
like she's not looking at you?

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,640
Impossible.

24
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,640
Shen Qianyu, go for it!

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,920
Go, Shen Qianyu!

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,200
Shen Qianyu, go for it!

27
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,480
The person you like is Shen Qianyu?

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,240
Yes. Why?

29
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,280
Then...

30
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,000
Then why did you...

31
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,200
Why did you keep smiling at me?

32
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,240
Who was looking at you?

33
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,640
I was looking at Qianyu.

34
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,360
But you kept blocking my view

35
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,320
and spouting nonsense.

36
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,800
You praised me during military training.

37
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,360
You have some nerves to mention that.

38
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,280
If you hadn't posed as Zhang Lurang,

39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,800
would we have got your names wrong?

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,800
You got our names wrong?

41
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,360
You got our names wrong?

42
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,360
Yes.

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,640
How could you get our names wrong?

44
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,560
One has two characters.
The other has three.

45
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
One is Zhang. The other is Gu.

46
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,840
One is

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,880
handsome.

48
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,320
And the other is even more so!

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
How could you get our names wrong?

50
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,280
Are you asking me?

51
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,360
{\an8}This is a huge misunderstanding.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,840
So were you praising Zhang Lurang?

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,120
Of course. Would I praise you?

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,959
Did he wake up
on the wrong side of the bed?

55
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,520
So that's the truth.

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,680
Only an instant cardio-reliever pill

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,040
can save him now.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
No wonder.

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,040
I wondered why you were always around

60
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,560
when I played basketball with Qianyu.

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,800
You do have ulterior motives.

62
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,800
Watch what you say.

63
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
What do you mean by...

64
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,080
Did you call him Qianyu?

65
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,680
Do you know him?

66
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,720
Yes. Our dads are colleagues.

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,800
We play basketball together a lot.

68
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,760
What?

69
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,760
You had such a long game just now.

70
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,280
Are you tired? Are you thirsty?

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,480
Do you have enough milk tea?

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,600
Would you like me to buy you another cup?

73
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,720
<i>Hey, Gu Ran.</i>

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,280
Don't go!

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,080
You said Qianyu likes the color white.

76
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,080
What kind of white?

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,800
Off-white? Ivory? Cream?

78
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,080
Gu Ran, don't be so petty!

79
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,520
We could talk about something else,

80
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,080
such as what Qianyu likes to eat,

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,280
drink, or read.

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,600
You should know all that, right?

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,640
Can you stop following me?

84
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
<i>Gu Ran, don't run!</i>

85
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,800
Why are you still here?

86
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,760
It's none of your business.

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,720
Gu Ran.

88
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,760
My dad is working overtime today.

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,720
So are your parents.

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,040
Why don't we dine out together?

91
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,520
Sure.

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,960
You can bring your friend if you want.

93
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,320
-I don't...
-Me!

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,560
I want to come too.

95
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,000
Are we friends?

96
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,800
Of course not.

97
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,160
Our relationship exceeds friendship.

98
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,000
{\an8}We were late and got punished together.

99
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,400
We've been through thick and thin.

100
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,120
Our friendship is more precious than gold.

101
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,680
Don't force me to tell people
that you were locked in.

102
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,760
She is absolutely right.

103
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,760
We...

104
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,920
We're really good friends.

105
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,800
-Let's go then.
-Let's go!

106
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,240
DRAMA CLUB

107
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,360
I forgot.

108
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,800
I have to help Ms. Zhang

109
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,760
tabulate the scores for the midterms.

110
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,920
You guys should leave first.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Are you doing it alone?

112
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes. I just have a little left.

113
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,560
Do you think I'm capable?

114
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,720
Are you a little impressed?

115
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,320
You sure aren't humble.

116
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,280
We'll get going then.

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
-Bye.
-Bye.

118
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,200
Why is it suddenly raining?

119
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,560
It doesn't look like
it will stop anytime soon.

120
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,960
I guess I'll wait.

121
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,640
Rangrang,

122
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,160
I read my horoscope the other day.

123
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,880
The book said my lucky element is water.

124
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
I didn't believe it at first,

125
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,320
but now I think it's pretty accurate.

126
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,280
Why?

127
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,159
Because good things happen when it rains.

128
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,560
I first met you

129
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
at a corner store in the rain.

130
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
I learned your name

131
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,120
in a field in the rain.

132
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,480
All rainy days

133
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,840
seem connected to you.

134
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,960
It rained three times last week

135
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,840
and twice this week.

136
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,480
In that case,

137
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,080
only rainy days connected to you

138
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,440
are meaningful to me.

139
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Rangrang, surely you didn't come back

140
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,360
just for me today?

141
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,240
I forgot my notes.

142
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,000
I see.

143
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,880
If it rains next time

144
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,600
and you don't bring an umbrella,

145
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,320
you can check in the teacher's office.

146
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,640
They might have a spare umbrella.

147
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,840
But if you tell me in advance

148
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,960
that you will be coming,

149
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,560
I don't mind being in the rain again.

150
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,480
Here.

151
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,600
Your house is up ahead.

152
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,800
You can take the umbrella.

153
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,520
Rangrang!

154
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,760
See you tomorrow!

155
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,800
<i>Did you win the lottery?</i>

156
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,240
Why are you suddenly treating me?

157
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,640
You're so cheerful too.

158
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,280
The food in the canteen
was delicious today.

159
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,440
Can't I be happy about it?

160
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,080
Hurry up and choose.

161
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,520
You said it's your treat.

162
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,120
I won't hold back.

163
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,240
A treat?

164
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
Who is treating?

165
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,760
Me! I'm feeling happy today.

166
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,960
I'm treating everyone.

167
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,400
Then I won't hold back either.

168
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,000
Hurry.

169
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,680
-Get more.
-Why is it them again?

170
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,200
They sure like the attention.

171
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,960
Let's go.

172
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,720
Zaizai, do you have enough pocket money?

173
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,400
Rest assured.

174
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,760
My dad gave me money this morning.

175
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,840
What should I get for Rangrang?

176
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,360
Did they all go out for lunch?

177
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,200
Keep it up!

178
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,160
A REWARD FROM FAIRY ZAI!

179
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,000
Su Zaizai?

180
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,760
Why are you here?

181
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
Of course I have something going on.

182
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,080
Don't you have your own classroom?

183
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,560
Why do you keep visiting our class?

184
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
Is English the first class after lunch?

185
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,960
What's wrong?

186
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
I'm doomed.

187
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,800
There's dictation. I'm doomed.

188
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,960
I forgot to memorize them!

189
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,000
Has anyone seen an envelope?

190
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,080
-An envelope?
-Yes.

191
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,360
Is it a love letter?

192
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,120
What love letter? It's our class fund!

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,280
Is the class fund missing?

194
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes, I just went out to get newspapers.

195
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,240
It was gone when I came back.

196
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,880
Don't panic. Look for it again.

197
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,280
-You should tell the teacher quickly.
-That shouldn't be.

198
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,880
Okay.

199
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,880
Ms. Zhang!

200
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,360
Ms. Zhang!

201
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,760
Ye Zhenxin, why are you panicking?

202
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,800
Our class fund seems to have been stolen!

203
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,840
I can't find it anywhere.

204
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,040
Don't jump to conclusions.

205
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,160
It's serious if it involves theft.

206
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,520
That's right.

207
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,800
Have you searched thoroughly?

208
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
I was counting the money

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
in the classroom during lunch.

210
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,080
Midway through,
I went to the mart to buy a pen.

211
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,480
Then I went to get newspapers
at the Office of Academic Affairs.

212
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,520
The money was gone when I returned.

213
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,760
How long were you away?

214
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,400
Was there no one in the classroom?

215
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,080
I was away for about ten minutes.

216
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,440
When I returned,

217
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,240
I only saw

218
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,880
one person, Su Zaizai.

219
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,160
Stop crying.

220
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,400
-Let's go check the security footage.
-Okay.

221
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,520
Mr. Chang, calm down first.

222
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,640
Ye Zhenxin might have

223
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,240
accidentally left the money somewhere.

224
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,480
Let's look for it again.

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,880
The security camera caught everything.

226
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,160
Ye Zhenxin has always been
an exemplary student.

227
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,640
Why would she lie?

228
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,280
Mr. Chang.

229
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,720
Mr. Chang,

230
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,200
you wanted to see me?

231
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,960
Su Zaizai,

232
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,960
during the break,

233
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,440
did you visit Class 1?

234
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,960
I did.

235
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Why did you go there?

236
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,560
Did you go to see a teacher?

237
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,280
Did something happen?

238
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,960
Class 1's class fund is missing.

239
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,800
When we checked the security footage,

240
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,400
you were the only one in Class 1

241
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,760
during the break.

242
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,400
So

243
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
are you suspecting me
of stealing the money?

244
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,760
I didn't steal anything.

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,280
Mr. Chang.

246
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,240
I believe Su Zaizai wouldn't steal.

247
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,840
She has always been a good student.

248
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,680
She's also very helpful. She...

249
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,280
We'll just talk about the facts today.

250
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,640
Tell us.

251
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,520
Why did you go

252
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,520
to Class 1?

253
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,880
I went to see my friend,

254
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,080
but he wasn't there.

255
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,160
Su Zaizai,

256
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,840
during the break,

257
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,000
didn't you treat several classmates
to snacks

258
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,160
in the mart today?

259
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,640
Where did that money come from?

260
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,760
What are you implying?

261
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,480
That was my own money.

262
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,040
I went to the mart

263
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,160
before visiting your class.

264
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,760
Is there any relation between the two?

265
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,400
I just want
to clear up the misunderstanding.

266
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,160
In that case,

267
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,840
you went there after me as well.

268
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,240
Doesn't that also make you a suspect?

269
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,520
What nonsense is that?

270
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,880
That's impossible.

271
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,560
Ye Zhenxin went back to her own classroom.

272
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,800
Mr. Chang,

273
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,200
I don't think my class has any relevance.

274
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,760
If you suspect me of taking the money,

275
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,000
Ye Zhenxin should prove it with evidence.

276
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,120
The burden of proof shouldn't be mine.

277
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,360
Su Zaizai.

278
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,960
We are all willing

279
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,680
to believe you.

280
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,680
But you have to give us
a reasonable explanation.

281
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,800
You're from Class 9.

282
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,680
Why weren't you in your classroom

283
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,480
instead of visiting Class 1?

284
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,520
She was there to see me.

285
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,440
<i>Sometimes, falling for a person</i>

286
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,480
<i>can happen in an instant.</i>

287
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,560
<i>I remember that moment clearly.</i>

288
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,160
<i>It was a rainy day.</i>

289
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,080
<i>It was the moment he glanced over.</i>

290
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,920
<i>It was the moment our eyes met.</i>

291
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,040
<i>But I never understood</i>

292
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,200
<i>the reason I fell for him.</i>

293
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,200
<i>But the lucky thing is</i>

294
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,600
<i>I've never regretted it.</i>

295
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,240
<i>I've never regretted going to the mart</i>

296
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,720
<i>when it was raining.</i>

297
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,960
<i>I've never regretted</i>

298
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,760
<i>scolding him for no reason.</i>

299
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,280
<i>I've never regretted meeting him</i>

300
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,560
<i>and then falling for him.</i>

301
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,240
She knew you were not in the classroom,

302
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,079
but she still entered your class.

303
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,240
Why is that?

304
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,560
She was there to bring me notes.

305
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Notes?

306
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,400
Su Zaizai explained a problem to me once.

307
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,359
I know about that.

308
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,640
I asked her to do it.

309
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,839
I thought she explained it well,

310
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,760
so I asked her to tutor me.

311
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,280
She was there today to give me notes.

312
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,079
Here are the notes.

313
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,560
{\an8}CLASSIFICATION OF VERBS

314
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,600
{\an8}AUXILIARY VERBS, MODAL VERBS

315
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,560
Students helping each other out

316
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,680
is a good thing.

317
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,920
You should've told us from the start.

318
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,040
But Mr. Chang,

319
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,600
we still haven't found the class fund.

320
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,040
Besides,

321
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,800
during that period,

322
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,840
Su Zaizai was indeed the only one
in our classroom.

323
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,320
And after I left,

324
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,880
you were also alone in the classroom.

325
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,600
I discovered that the money was missing

326
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,600
after I returned.

327
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,920
Also, if you weren't feeling guilty,

328
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,680
why didn't you explain things

329
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,720
before Zhang Lurang got here?

330
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
I asked her to keep it a secret.

331
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,600
Because I don't want others to know

332
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,080
that my English scores are so bad

333
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,560
and I need to be tutored

334
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,960
by a student from a regular class.

335
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,080
That's not a good way to think.

336
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,480
What's wrong with a regular class?

337
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,800
Everyone has their strengths.

338
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,960
Su Zaizai was kind enough

339
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,360
to tutor you

340
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,120
and she even got misunderstood.

341
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,320
It might not be a misunderstanding.

342
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,880
Ye Zhenxin,

343
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,920
we do not have sufficient evidence

344
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,920
to prove that Su Zaizai took the money.

345
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,640
Before the truth comes to light,

346
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
if we spread baseless rumors

347
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,120
based on our speculations,

348
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,480
that would hurt other students too.

349
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,480
Don't you think so?

350
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,400
That's right, Mr. Chang.

351
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,760
I feel

352
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,720
we should investigate this properly.

353
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,960
You're right.

354
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,680
How about this, Ms. Zhang?

355
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,200
Return to the classroom first

356
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,480
and search the classroom thoroughly.

357
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,040
Before we have any concrete clues,

358
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,880
let's not suspect any student.

359
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,800
Okay, Mr. Chang.

360
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,920
I will investigate this properly.

361
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,760
Okay. Leave this matter to the teachers.

362
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,880
Head back first.

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,920
Let's go.

364
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,240
Wait. Your notes.

365
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,840
They're pretty good.

366
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,800
Keep it up.

367
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,080
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

368
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,120
Su Zaizai.

369
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,000
You...

370
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,160
Why didn't you tell them just now?

371
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,120
Why didn't you say
that you came to see me?

372
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,320
Didn't you say

373
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,720
that you don't want others to know

374
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,680
you're bad at English

375
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,040
and need to be tutored

376
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,480
by a student from a regular class?

377
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,280
I feel the same way.

378
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,920
I'm worried you might feel embarrassed.

379
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,680
That's not it.

380
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,720
I don't find it embarrassing.

381
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,800
I also don't want the teachers

382
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,920
to misunderstand you.

383
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,720
However, I really didn't know

384
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,400
your class collected class funds today.

385
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,760
And I don't know where Ye Zhenxin sits.

386
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,040
I just wanted to put the notes

387
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,440
on your table

388
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,000
along with the snacks and cola.

389
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,280
Su Zaizai.

390
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,440
I believe you.

391
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
<i>The more I think about it,
the angrier I feel.</i>

392
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,080
How could they interrogate you

393
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,200
without any evidence?

394
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,240
I just hope they find the money quickly.

395
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,600
Otherwise, even without evidence,

396
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,320
they will still suspect me.

397
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,760
What if they really can't find it?

398
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,640
Shouldn't the person
who lost it be held responsible?

399
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,000
That makes sense.

400
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,880
Ye Zhenxin is not a kid.

401
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,600
How could she lose the funds like that?

402
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,760
Or is it that no matter what happens,

403
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,880
you can act sorry
and cry your way out of it?

404
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,840
Why don't you cry too?

405
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,960
You should act pitiful too.
Anyone can do that!

406
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,640
That's right. You should cry too.

407
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,800
Cry.

408
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,560
Like this?

409
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,880
No, that's not real enough.

410
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,000
GRADE 10, CLASS 1

411
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,400
Who stole it?

412
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,160
I heard it was Su Zaizai from Class 9.

413
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,560
So she stole it?

414
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,400
I think so.

415
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,360
Didn't you see her steal it that day?

416
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,520
What are you talking about?

417
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,160
The tri-city joint exam
is right around the corner.

418
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,800
Must you talk during class?

419
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,920
Regarding the class fund,

420
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
please refrain from discussing it.

421
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,240
Let's all look for it after class.

422
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,400
Even if we can't find it,

423
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,080
the teachers will handle it.

424
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,680
Just focus on your studies.

425
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Help me pass it.

426
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
What is this?

427
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,480
I knew it.

428
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,720
-Pass it back.
-Okay.

429
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,280
I THINK IT WAS HER!

430
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,800
WE SHOULD GET IT BACK FROM HER.

431
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,920
HAVE YOU HEARD?
WE LOST OUR CLASS FUNDS.

432
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,040
WHAT? IT'S OVER 2,000 YUAN!

433
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,960
FOR SOME REASON,

434
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,640
A GIRL FROM CLASS 9
WAS IN OUR CLASSROOM.

435
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,640
Jiangjiang.

436
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,360
Jiangjiang.

437
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,880
Are you going straight home after school?

438
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,200
-If you have time...
-You go first.

439
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,240
I have plans. Be careful on your way home.

440
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,040
Ma'am, where is
Class 1's trash from today?

441
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,760
We have so much trash every day.

442
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,720
How would I remember?

443
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,040
We dump them all together.

444
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,480
But all the trash from Grade 10 is here.

445
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,320
There's another heap there too.

446
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,920
Thank you, ma'am.

447
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,880
No problem.

448
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,280
I don't see it here either.

449
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,600
Search more thoroughly!

450
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,120
Zhang Lurang, take that one.

451
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,960
Su Zaizai.

452
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,160
What do you mean by Su Zaizai?

453
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,800
That sundae was quite yummy.

454
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,640
-Let's go after class.
-Sure.

455
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
We'll go after class.

456
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,560
Ye Zhenxin, have you found the class fund?

457
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,320
No.

458
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,640
I thought you found it

459
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,200
since you seem so relaxed.

460
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,600
That's right.

461
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,600
You're acting
like we're the ones who lost it.

462
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,240
I helped collect the class funds.

463
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,960
Am I to blame for it being missing?

464
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Ye Zhenxin.

465
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,800
Why don't you think it over again?

466
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,080
Could it be that you misplaced it?

467
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,840
I don't understand.

468
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,960
Why do you guys trust someone
from another class so much?

469
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,920
Okay. Do you guys not believe me?

470
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,440
Here. Search for yourselves.

471
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,800
You had better find it.

472
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,520
Otherwise, I...

473
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,160
What?

474
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,480
What will you do?

475
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,600
What is in the book?

476
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,520
-It really is her.
-It's her.

477
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,040
She put it in her book.

478
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,000
Is that the class fund?

479
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,680
Do you really want us
to see it for ourselves?

480
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,080
She really had it.

481
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,800
-Did she hide it herself?
-She must've hid it, right?

482
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,680
Don't malign me!

483
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,360
{\an8}I really couldn't find it yesterday!

484
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,280
{\an8}Who knows

485
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,920
{\an8}if Su Zaizai put it back here?

486
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,200
{\an8}Ye Zhenxin.

487
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,000
Rumors can do a lot of damage.

488
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,360
Haven't you realized that by now?

489
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,480
I'm sorry, Zhang Lurang.

490
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,520
I dragged you into this by accident.

491
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,320
I'm really sorry.

492
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,840
You don't have to apologize to me.

493
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
You owe Su Zaizai an apology.

494
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
It has been found!

495
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,680
What has been found?

496
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,480
That thing. Class 1's class fund.

497
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,240
They found it in their own classroom!

498
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,240
That's great.
Your innocence has been proven.

499
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,400
How did they find it?

500
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,800
I was just getting there.

501
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,840
It's so dramatic!

502
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,880
The money

503
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,720
was right inside their class rep's bag.

504
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,080
They found it on the spot!

505
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,440
She totally made a fool of herself.

506
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,240
Why didn't they find it before?

507
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,440
She never searched properly.

508
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,960
This is outrageous.

509
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,320
The money was with her all along.

510
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,560
How could she accuse you so confidently?

511
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,680
That's right.

512
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,240
I'm going out for a bit.

513
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,360
Where are you going?
Are you skipping your break?

514
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,480
I need an apology.

515
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,680
I'll go with you!

516
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,560
What's going on?

517
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,760
I don't know. Let's see.

518
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,800
Look.

519
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,440
Do you need this many people to watch?

520
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,720
It's break time.
There are people everywhere.

521
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
If you prefer,

522
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,640
we could go to the teacher's office

523
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,560
and talk in private.

524
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,880
We'll do it here then.

525
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,760
I'm sorry. All right?

526
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,040
Do you call that an apology?

527
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,560
You didn't even look into my eyes.

528
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,320
Okay, I'll say it again.

529
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,720
I am sorry.

530
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,280
Surely you've heard it now?

531
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,480
I heard it.

532
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,800
But

533
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,080
I don't accept it.

534
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,880
What do you mean?

535
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,040
"I'm sorry" and "It's fine"

536
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
are sincere words

537
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,760
spoken to correct mistakes and hurt.

538
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,480
They are not words spoken carelessly

539
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,640
as you just did

540
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,880
{\an8}to pretend that mistakes didn't occur.

541
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
{\an8}If that's the case,

542
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,920
I don't accept this apology.

543
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,280
-Su Zaizai!
-That girl is pretty cool.

544
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
What is her name?

545
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,480
I don't know.

546
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,760
Zhang Lurang, have dinner at my place.

547
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,360
My grandma has been talking

548
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,120
about letting you guys try her new dish.

549
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,800
Tonight?

550
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,680
Come on. It's the weekend tomorrow anyway.

551
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,280
I've told Su Zaizai and the others too.

552
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,800
Okay.

553
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,640
Actually, I really have to thank
Guan Fang and the guys.

554
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,560
No matter how other people suspected me,

555
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,480
they always believed me.

556
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,280
They even helped me find the money
in the end.

557
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,160
I am very grateful to them.

558
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,520
Boys this age are like that.

559
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,160
They look childish,

560
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,200
but instead of speaking nice words,

561
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,200
they prefer to show it with their actions.

562
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,320
Here.

563
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,240
Take your time eating, all right?

564
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,240
I'm going to the other street
for some ingredients.

565
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Grandma, I'll go with you.

566
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,560
No, I can go by myself.

567
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,240
Just keep your friends company.

568
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,160
Take whatever you need.

569
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,160
Okay.

570
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,640
What were you guys talking about?

571
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,600
Nothing.

572
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,160
Here. Cheers.

573
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,640
I'll treat everyone
to the amusement park tomorrow.

574
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,400
-Cheers!
-Bottoms up!

575
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,240
By the way,

576
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,000
who asked Ye Zhenxin to check her bag?

577
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,320
Didn't she insist that she didn't have it?

578
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,800
I think it was...

579
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,360
The two of them.

580
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,680
Was it us?

581
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,840
I don't really remember.

582
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,560
No matter who it was,

583
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,960
I'm really grateful.

584
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,560
I am actually pretty touched.

585
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,880
We usually fool around.

586
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,920
Being so serious feels so weird.

587
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,640
And don't people usually cry

588
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,440
during such touching moments in dramas?

589
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,560
You didn't cry at all.

590
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,400
No problem.

591
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,840
Zaizai, cry.

592
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,760
Listen, Zaizai is really good

593
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,800
at pretending to cry.

594
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,840
She trembles and her shoulders shake.
She can also...

595
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,040
That's hard to believe.

596
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,280
Is it that realistic?

597
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,280
It is.

598
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,120
Have you seen it?

599
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,280
Are you angry because I pretended to cry?

600
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,160
No.

601
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,840
What is on your mind then?

602
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,560
In the teacher's office,

603
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,400
Ye Zhenxin cried,

604
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,360
so the teachers all sided with her.

605
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,920
Since you're so good at pretending to cry,

606
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,640
why did you only fume?

607
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,240
Why should I cry?

608
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,880
Only those who made mistakes cry.

609
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
I wasn't in the wrong.

610
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,720
I'll head back first then.

611
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,600
Zhang Lurang.

612
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,800
Guan Fang secretly told me this.

613
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,920
You demanded an apology

614
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,040
from Ye Zhenxin for me.

615
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,360
-I...
-Thank you.

616
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,520
I just wanted to say thank you.

617
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,200
Good night. See you tomorrow.

618
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,720
Zaizai!

619
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,960
It's not our meet-up time yet.

620
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,160
Why are you guys so early?

621
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,240
How can we not be enthusiastic
about going to the amusement park?

622
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,160
Everybody is here now. Let's go.

623
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,120
Let's go!

624
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,720
I want this one!

625
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,280
Only girls would like that.

626
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,120
What do you think? Is it cute?

627
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,280
{\an8}Ours is a pair.

628
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,560
Here, I'll get the same one for you.

629
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,800
You must wear it.

630
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,000
Otherwise, people might think

631
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,120
we're excluding you.

632
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,320
Are you happy now?

633
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,680
Let's go!

634
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,760
Hey.

635
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,320
Can I ask you for a favor?

636
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
Look.

637
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,239
Why are you wearing the same one as mine?

638
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,679
It's not like I want to.

639
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,639
It's because...

640
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,239
Well, it's because

641
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,800
my head is too big.

642
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
And it happened

643
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,040
that Su Zaizai's headband was bigger,

644
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,080
so we swapped.

645
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,800
Don't forget the comics you promised me.

646
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,800
You have my word.

647
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,920
I haven't been
to an amusement park in ages!

648
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,440
I want to ride that! Come on!

649
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,800
Hurry up!

650
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,200
Come on!

651
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,800
{\an8}I'm spent!

652
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,560
{\an8}We've taken the pendulum three times.

653
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,840
{\an8}I'll never take my feet
off the ground again.

654
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,760
I'm never going
on such a thrilling ride again.

655
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,480
We can't waste the ticket!

656
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,720
Why are you guys sitting down?

657
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,360
Won't you consider
going on the Ferris Wheel?

658
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,680
Zaizai,

659
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,680
you don't need to count me in.

660
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,800
I've also reached my limit.

661
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,600
I don't mind sitting in the breeze here.

662
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,640
Then what about you, Zhang Lurang?

663
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,960
Sure.

664
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,720
It's beautiful.

665
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,960
Make a wish.

666
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,520
Make a wish?

667
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,000
Don't you watch dramas?

668
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,960
A wish made

669
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,400
at the Ferris Wheel's highest point

670
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,000
has the greatest chance of coming true.

671
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,120
I don't have any wishes.

672
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,040
I'll make two wishes then.

673
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,280
I won't wish for things

674
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,600
like suddenly becoming smart

675
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,960
or winning the lottery.

676
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,360
I'll make the simplest wishes.

677
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,040
My first wish is that we all did well

678
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,440
in the exam we just finished.

679
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,560
My second wish

680
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,280
is that Rangrang will smile more.

681
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,600
I noticed that he has dimples
when he smiles.

682
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,680
It looks so nice.

683
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,840
Rangrang.

684
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,440
You smiled, didn't you?

685
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,200
I didn't.

686
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,120
You clearly did.

687
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,360
<i>Today, let me introduce my best friends.</i>

688
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,360
<i>Be clear. Who is the best?</i>

689
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,120
<i>Jiang Jia, why are you so competitive?</i>

690
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,800
<i>So what if I am? So what?</i>

691
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,280
<i>-Childish.
-You're the childish one!</i>

692
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,880
<i>All right. Ignore them.</i>

693
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,880
<i>Why don't I go first?</i>

694
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,400
<i>What's with that?</i>

695
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,360
{\an8}<i>Okay, I'll start over.</i>

696
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,720
{\an8}<i>Let me introduce my best friends.</i>

697
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,480
{\an8}<i>Zhang Lurang, come closer.</i>

698
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,680
{\an8}<i>They are Zhang Lurang...</i>

699
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,400
{\an8}<i>Su Zaizai, I should come first!</i>

700
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,960
{\an8}<i>Okay.</i>

701
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,640
{\an8}<i>They are Jiang Jia,</i>

702
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,240
{\an8}<i>Zhang Lurang,</i>

703
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,400
{\an8}<i>Gu Ran,</i>

704
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,520
{\an8}<i>and Guan Fang.</i>

705
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,360
<i>Why did I come last? Start over.</i>

706
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,120
<i>Hey, you pressed the wrong button!</i>

707
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,400
<i>If I could stop time,</i>

708
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,160
<i>I would never let our friendship fade.</i>

709
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,200
<i>I wouldn't let any of them slip away.</i>

710
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:51,000
IF I COULD STOP TIME,
I WOULD NEVER LET OUR FRIENDSHIP FADE.

711
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:58,000
I WOULDN'T LET ANY OF THEM SLIP AWAY.
