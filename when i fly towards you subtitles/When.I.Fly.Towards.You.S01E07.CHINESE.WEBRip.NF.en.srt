00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,640
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

3
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,000
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

4
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,200
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,080
<i>Good Job, I'll Reward You With Ten Points.</i>

6
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,360
Where is Zaizai?

7
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,640
Qianyu?

8
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
Who are you peeking at?

9
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,520
What are you doing?

10
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
Are you too shy

11
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,760
to go talk to Qianyu?

12
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,960
As if! It's nothing to be shy about.

13
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,680
Go on then.

14
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,040
You're always at my heels
and questioning me,

15
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,520
but you're such a coward in front of him.

16
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,880
Why didn't I realize
how two-faced you are, Jiang Jia?

17
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
It's none of your business.

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
It's absolutely my business.

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,200
Look.

20
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,320
We are so close.

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,320
I should deliver your feelings to him.

22
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,680
Just wait. I'll tell him.

23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,000
Qianyu!

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,440
Gu Ran, how dare you!

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,000
Jiang Jia, are you afraid of this?

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,320
Fine, I won't tell him.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,320
Well, it depends on your performance.

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,560
What?

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,360
I'm a little thirsty.

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,640
{\an8}Please drink it.

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,320
I just finished doing the shot put.

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,600
My arms are sore.

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,560
I'll do it.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,680
{\an8}It feels refreshing.

35
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,080
{\an8}All right. That's it then.

36
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,480
{\an8}I'll call you again if I need you.

37
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,480
You may go.

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
Gu Ran, this is considered blackmail!

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,760
Sue me.

40
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,760
I...

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,800
Zhang Lurang!

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,880
You have a medal!

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,320
That's amazing.

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,920
I'm only the runner-up.

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,600
"Only"?

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,320
Being the runner-up is amazing.

47
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,160
Why are you looking down on second place?

48
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
I don't.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,120
It's only meaningful if I win.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,560
Why?

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,960
First and second place
are both meaningful.

52
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,640
If I get to compete,

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,280
I'll feel great even if I get last place.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,280
So you are very amazing already.

55
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,040
However,

56
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,800
this silver medal

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,880
looks like it's tied to a red scarf.

58
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,440
It looks quite nice.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,320
If you like it,

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,520
I'll give it to you.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,279
Su Zaizai!

62
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,399
It's time to take group photos! Come here!

63
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm coming!

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,920
I have to go.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,960
Wait for me tonight.

66
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,320
Make sure to wait for me.

67
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,960
Isn't that Zhang Lurang's medal?

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,960
Yes.

69
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,200
Zhang Lurang.

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
Why did you give your medal
to someone else?

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She likes it.

72
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,280
Rangrang,

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
you should

74
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,640
keep this medal.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,240
Why?

76
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
This is the first medal you got

77
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,760
while I was watching.

78
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,920
It is very meaningful.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
I'm just joking.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,440
I think being a runner-up

81
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,160
is also meaningful to you.

82
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,520
You don't need to give it to me

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
just because I like it.

84
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,560
Besides,

85
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,000
it's not the medal itself that I like.

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
-I...
-You like...

87
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,080
No.

88
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,160
I have never. I swear!

89
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,120
I swear.

90
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,960
I'm only 16 years old this year.

91
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,640
I...

92
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,960
<i>Did he ask you so suddenly?</i>

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,080
Yes.

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,560
It was very sudden.

95
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,960
<i>What did you say?</i>

96
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
I told him

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,160
that I'm only 16 years old

98
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,280
and have never given it much thought.

99
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,800
<i>You are 16 years old.</i>

100
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,080
<i>Is Zhang Lurang 60 years old?</i>

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,560
Stop laughing at me.

102
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,000
Help me analyze it.

103
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,800
Why did he ask me that?

104
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,160
<i>Be prepared.</i>

105
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,440
<i>With my years of experience
consuming novels and dramas,</i>

106
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,880
<i>most people who ask that question</i>

107
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,440
<i>either want to say</i>

108
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,640
<i>they like you</i>

109
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,280
<i>or they don't like you.</i>

110
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,320
Whatever.

111
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,840
He didn't say he liked me or hated me.

112
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,040
At least we are still friends.

113
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
That's enough for me.

114
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,960
<i>Rangrang, congratulations</i>

115
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,280
<i>on getting a good score.</i>

116
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,240
<i>I hope</i>

117
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,440
<i>you'll continue to study hard
and keep up the good work.</i>

118
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,280
<i>Ms. Su Zaizai is serious, responsible,</i>

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,240
<i>positive, and cute.</i>

120
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,160
<i>A long-term collaboration with her</i>

121
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,280
<i>is the way to go.</i>

122
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,480
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL

123
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,320
Judging from the last examination's data,

124
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,560
we can see

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,920
that the students of Grade 10

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,320
show very different studying capabilities.

127
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,600
AVERAGE SCORES OF EACH CLASS

128
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,760
The honors classes, Classes 1 and 2,

129
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,400
have a much higher academic performance

130
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,760
than the normal classes.

131
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,480
I hope they can keep up

132
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
the good work.

133
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,560
Of course,

134
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,280
the homeroom teachers of normal classes

135
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,320
shouldn't be dejected.

136
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,880
There are special cases too.

137
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,040
Take Zhang Yan's two classes, for example.

138
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,440
Although Class 1's average result

139
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,360
is in the lead by a lot,

140
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,640
their English results alone

141
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
is not as good as that of Class 9.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,520
Class 9 does have students

143
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,720
who are very good at English.

144
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,320
I never have to push them to learn.

145
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,320
I think this is good.

146
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,840
We should let excellent students

147
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,200
set an example for others

148
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,760
so that they can improve together.

149
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,720
If possible,

150
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,080
we can send excellent students
to other classes

151
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,640
to share their ways of studying.

152
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,320
I think this is a good idea.

153
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Some students aren't bad at studying

154
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,880
or unwilling to study.

155
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,600
They just aren't using the right method.

156
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,920
That was why they wasted their time

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,160
without improving their results.

158
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,440
With other students' help,

159
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,960
that can change.

160
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,280
For example, Su Zaizai from our class

161
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,400
didn't pass the math subject
in her entrance exam.

162
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,160
However, ever since
she formed a study group

163
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,400
with Class 1's Zhang Lurang,

164
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,799
her math scores
have improved significantly.

165
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Let me give you an example

166
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,440
of a study experience sharing session.

167
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Ever since our class's Zhang Lurang

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,440
received Su Zaizai's help,

169
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,800
his English score has improved

170
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,920
from 80 to 100.

171
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,240
Quiet.

172
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,000
So I've discussed it with Mr. Lin.

173
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
We won't give lectures

174
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,040
in the last two classes.

175
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,760
The highest scorers of a single subject

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
in the last monthly exam from both classes

177
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,120
will go to the other class

178
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,720
for the study experience sharing session.

179
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,960
Do you all understand?

180
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,080
-Yes.
-Yes.

181
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,200
Good.

182
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,280
How is it? Is it messy?

183
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,640
How long have you been doing your hair?

184
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,080
Jiangjiang,

185
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,440
I'm a little nervous.

186
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,840
What is there to be nervous about?

187
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,320
You have given Zhang Lurang
so many tutoring lessons.

188
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,920
This is different.

189
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,960
It was one-on-one with Zhang Lurang.

190
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
This time, I'll face the whole class.

191
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,960
Besides,

192
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,520
if I don't nail it,

193
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,240
the students from his class

194
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
will laugh at me
for daring to teach Zhang Lurang.

195
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,760
I can't let that happen.

196
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,240
You're right.

197
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,920
That's all for my experience.

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,680
If there is anything you don't understand,

199
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,000
you can go to Class 9 and ask me.

200
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,480
-Su Zaizai, I have a question.
-Su Zaizai.

201
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,520
I have a question.

202
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,080
Can you explain this to me?

203
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,040
-Can you help me?
-Ask me one by one, please.

204
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll answer you one by one.

205
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,800
They're not usually this serious
when Ms. Zhang is teaching.

206
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,720
Is it too late to ask Su Zaizai

207
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,880
to give me English lessons?

208
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,920
Yes.

209
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,800
Why?

210
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,400
When she taught me,

211
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
it was one-on-one.

212
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
Su Zaizai.

213
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,960
What?

214
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,960
It's time to go home.

215
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,640
I'm coming.

216
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,080
Well, I'll explain it to you

217
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
when I get a chance.

218
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,560
I'm leaving. Bye.

219
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,160
Wait for me!

220
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,560
Rangrang, did you leave so quickly

221
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,480
because you were afraid
that I would ignore you

222
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
if I tutored all of them?

223
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,160
No.

224
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,720
It's okay if you did.

225
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,640
Don't worry.

226
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,440
I will be responsible for you
until the end.

227
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,440
Did the school release an announcement?

228
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,440
Zaizai.

229
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,240
Didn't you leave with Gu Ran?

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,320
Hearing his name makes me angry.

231
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,320
Don't mention him.

232
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,160
Are you reading this too?

233
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,280
I haven't read it yet.

234
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,760
Don't bother.

235
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
No one knows about it better than I do.

236
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,160
The school anniversary

237
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,320
is happening soon.

238
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,880
The school requests all student clubs

239
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,000
to prepare a performance,

240
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,160
including the Drama Club.

241
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,120
What is our show then?

242
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,400
I knew you would be curious.

243
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,680
I have asked around.

244
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,400
It will be <i>Cinderella</i> for now.

245
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,680
The actors of the main roles
will be chosen among the new students.

246
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,520
If Zhang Lurang is the prince,

247
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,040
I'll audition for the role of Cinderella.

248
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,560
<i>What? Have you changed your mind again?</i>

249
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,040
I heard the prince will be played
by Shen Qianyu.

250
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,080
It's not Rangrang, so I'm not interested.

251
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,040
I think it's fine being an elf.

252
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,640
<i>I heard Ye Zhenxin</i>

253
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,880
<i>will be auditioning too.</i>

254
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,840
<i>If we apply together,</i>

255
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,960
<i>our chances of winning
will be much higher.</i>

256
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,880
<i>I'll be mad</i>

257
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,600
<i>if Ye Zhenxin gets the role of Cinderella.</i>

258
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,920
But...

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,480
<i>Think about it.</i>

260
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,640
<i>Cinderella's dress is the prettiest.</i>

261
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,920
<i>Don't you want Zhang Lurang</i>

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,640
<i>to see you at your prettiest?</i>

263
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,680
I do.

264
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,720
<i>That's right.</i>

265
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,720
<i>Don't worry.</i>

266
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,120
<i>This audition is fair and just.</i>

267
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,080
<i>If we prepare well,</i>

268
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,360
<i>the role will surely be ours.</i>

269
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,040
Zhang Lurang,

270
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
you know the audition for Cinderella

271
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,760
is today, right?

272
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,360
I want to audition for Cinderella.

273
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,400
We are from the same class.

274
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,400
Please vote for me.

275
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
I have cookies for everyone.

276
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,040
What an impressive way to get votes.

277
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
How unfortunate.

278
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,240
It's too bad I've been having a toothache.

279
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,480
I'm avoiding sweets.

280
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,320
I'm sure you know

281
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,040
that toothaches are contagious.

282
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,000
Zhang Lurang, what about you?

283
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,800
The choice should be made

284
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,600
after I watch
all the candidates' performances

285
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,800
in the audition.

286
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,200
That's right.

287
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,440
I'm well-prepared,

288
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,120
so I believe I'll win.

289
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,840
I have a feeling

290
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
that she is a competent rival.

291
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,640
"Ye Zhenxin."

292
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,960
SU ZAIZAI, YE ZHENXIN, JIANG JIA

293
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,760
"Ye Zhenxin."

294
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,440
{\an8}SU ZAIZAI, YE ZHENXIN,
JIANG JIA, WANG LINLIN, CHEN MENG

295
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,760
"Ye Zhenxin."

296
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,240
"Su Zaizai."

297
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,440
"Jiang Jia."

298
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,600
Students,

299
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,000
this is the final vote.

300
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,440
"Su Zaizai!"

301
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,960
Yes!

302
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,800
<i>I'm not convinced.</i>

303
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
Either Su Zaizai solicited votes in secret

304
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,240
or the audition was rigged.

305
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,360
Otherwise, how could she win
by just one vote?

306
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,560
A professional actor won't complain,

307
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,720
regardless of the role she gets.

308
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,720
This was decided by a vote.

309
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,680
I hope you can accept it
with an open mind.

310
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,360
If you still don't believe it,

311
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,360
I can show you the votes.

312
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,360
There's no need.

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,840
Goodbye, Qianyu.

314
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,880
Qianyu, I have a request.

315
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,600
I want to see the votes.

316
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,760
Why does the winner
want to see them as well?

317
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,760
"As well"?

318
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,000
Never mind.

319
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,320
These are all the votes.

320
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,000
Here you go.

321
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,000
Thank you, Qianyu.

322
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Lurang,

323
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,000
your ballot has a stain.

324
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,440
Do you want a new one?

325
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,360
It's fine. It can still be used.

326
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,440
SU ZAIZAI

327
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,600
In the Cinderella audition,

328
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,640
you voted for me.

329
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,640
I didn't.

330
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,520
Don't tell me you are feeling shy.

331
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
No.

332
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Did you really do that?

333
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,880
I don't remember.

334
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,240
Because you would back me up.

335
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,840
I wouldn't.

336
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,200
Zhang Lurang,

337
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,200
thank you.

338
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,000
He touches his neck when he lies.

339
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,360
Rangrang is cute even when he lies.

340
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,400
SU ZAIZAI

341
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,000
Actually, your vote is all I need.

342
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,280
<i>Rangrang,</i>

343
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,240
<i>I got the script for</i> Cinderella <i>today.</i>

344
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,160
<i>There are so many lines</i>

345
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,520
<i>and they're difficult to memorize.</i>

346
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,280
<i>Take your time memorizing then.</i>

347
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,960
<i>Rangrang, when you are free,</i>

348
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,800
<i>can you help me with my lines?</i>

349
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,120
<i>Why are you asking for my help?</i>

350
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,720
<i>That's because you have a good memory.</i>

351
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,160
<i>If you help me rehearse my lines,</i>

352
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,800
<i>I'll surely improve quickly.</i>

353
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,240
<i>It will only take
a little of your time every day.</i>

354
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,360
<i>Just a little.</i>

355
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,360
<i>If you can score 90 points</i>

356
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,360
<i>on the exam I give you</i>

357
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,080
<i>during our tutoring session in two days,</i>

358
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,200
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

359
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,760
Ninety points?

360
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,080
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

361
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,560
Ninety points is great.

362
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,720
It's an auspicious number.

363
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,160
I can do it if I work hard.

364
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,720
Ninety points?

365
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,960
I don't even dare to dream about it.

366
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,319
No, I must do it no matter what!

367
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,920
I must get 90 points.

368
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,560
<i>Rangrang,</i>

369
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,760
you are here so early.

370
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,720
NO. 9 WANGRONG ROAD

371
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,079
Why didn't you go in?

372
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,440
We can't go in today.

373
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,240
CLOSED TODAY

374
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,080
Why are they closed?

375
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,240
We can take a break for today.

376
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,560
No!

377
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,600
We agreed
to have a tutoring session today.

378
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,840
We can't waste time.

379
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,080
Besides,

380
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,680
I must do your exam today.

381
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,720
Come in. No one is home.

382
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,160
Sorry for disturbing you.

383
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,800
Susu.

384
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
{\an8}Rangrang, she still remembers me.

385
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,000
She seems to like you.

386
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,160
Well, she must take after her owner.

387
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,400
It was just a joke.

388
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,280
How do you know

389
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,080
I like watching television while studying?

390
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,480
It's not for you.

391
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,120
Then who is it for?

392
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,720
Is it for you?

393
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,520
Be good and watch television.

394
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,880
I'm going to study.

395
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,720
Rangrang,

396
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,360
is Susu usually the only one
with you at home?

397
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,360
My uncle also lives here.

398
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,280
Your uncle?

399
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,320
They say nephews and uncles look alike.

400
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,520
Is your uncle as handsome as you?

401
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,920
What does he do?

402
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,480
He's a math teacher.

403
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,240
Math teacher?

404
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,480
He's knowledgeable.

405
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,880
No wonder you are so good at math.

406
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,840
Do the exam first.

407
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,000
You wrote it by hand.

408
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,280
Did you make it just for me?

409
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,000
It's 4:30 p.m. now.

410
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,760
I'll grade your paper at 6:40 p.m.

411
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,440
It's so formal.

412
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,120
An exam should be formal.

413
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,560
<i>According to the latest census,</i>

414
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,600
<i>one-third of people over 18 years old</i>

415
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,000
<i>are single.</i>

416
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,920
<i>That means</i>

417
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,600
<i>one in three people in the country</i>

418
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,720
<i>is single.</i>

419
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,320
<i>50,9% of people</i>

420
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,520
<i>believe a small social circle</i>

421
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,200
<i>is the reason for singlehood.</i>

422
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,880
<i>24,5% of people...</i>

423
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,440
Ninety points.

424
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,000
Ninety points.

425
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,120
I'm done.

426
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,880
I'm five points short.

427
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,120
Rangrang, my answer for this one

428
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,560
was initially correct,

429
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,720
but I later changed it.

430
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,840
Can you grade it
based on my previous answer?

431
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,120
No.

432
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,000
{\an8}My calculation method

433
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,760
is correct for this question.

434
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,680
I gave you points for the method.

435
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,840
Why is it so difficult

436
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,000
to get five more points?

437
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,240
My uncle is back.

438
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,040
Lurang, you're home.

439
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Hello, sir.

440
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,880
Su Zaizai?

441
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,640
Are you having a tutoring session?

442
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes.

443
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,120
Lin...

444
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,000
Mr. Lin?

445
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,880
Given your reaction,

446
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,120
Zhang Lurang didn't tell you
I'm his uncle, did he?

447
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,240
He didn't.

448
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
You didn't ask.

449
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,680
Mr. Lin,

450
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,440
we are having an exam here.

451
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
It's finished.

452
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,040
Although I didn't get good results,

453
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,360
I intruded for too long.

454
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
-I should go.
-Hey, wait.

455
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,320
Su Zaizai, are you leaving like this?

456
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,520
This is unacceptable.

457
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,280
Mr. Lin,

458
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,160
we couldn't find a place
for the tutoring session,

459
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,600
so we came to your home.

460
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,080
This is not Zhang Lurang's fault.

461
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,440
How could you do this?

462
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,640
She came here to study.

463
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,040
How could you chase her away

464
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,160
because she didn't do well?

465
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,000
It's still early anyway.

466
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,320
Well, you can explain the problems

467
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,480
that she didn't understand.

468
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,080
What?

469
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,000
Stop asking.

470
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,920
Being passionate
about your studies is good.

471
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
It's all right.

472
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,680
If it gets too late,

473
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,200
I'll have Lurang see you home.

474
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,920
All right? Continue.

475
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,520
I'll be grading homework in the study.

476
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,240
I'll start with the second problem.

477
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,320
No wonder.

478
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,480
Now that I look at you closely,

479
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,720
you have Mr. Lin's eyebrows.

480
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,760
Am I the last to know?

481
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,320
I don't normally tell people.

482
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,560
That's great.

483
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,320
I'm the first person to know your secret.

484
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,360
I'll keep this a secret,

485
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
so add a few extra points

486
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,560
to my math paper.

487
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,520
This is not a secret.

488
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,680
There's no need to keep it.

489
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,560
Watch your step.

490
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,440
My main problem

491
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,400
is no one is rehearsing the lines with me.

492
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,720
I can only think about it while walking.

493
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,480
Perhaps

494
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,120
I will think about it while I'm eating,

495
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,120
sleeping,

496
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,960
and attending classes.

497
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,280
What should I do if this goes on?

498
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,280
{\an8}I think...

499
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,560
{\an8}You have been doing well
in the tutoring sessions.

500
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,200
You didn't skip any lessons

501
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,360
and you have been serious.

502
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,600
I can reward you with ten points.

503
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,440
Ten points?

504
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,520
I have 95 points then.

505
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,880
Rangrang,

506
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,040
do you agree to rehearse my lines with me?

507
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,120
Rangrang, you are so nice.

508
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,080
I'm just helping out.

509
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,040
Exactly.

510
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,760
Handsome and kind. You're so wonderful.

511
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,800
Is it your first time in my room?

512
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,720
Don't be so reserved.

513
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,080
Be casual.

514
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,320
Make yourselves at home.

515
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,560
Guan Fang,

516
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,400
I think you're the most reserved one.

517
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,960
Am I?

518
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,200
I don't think so.

519
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,640
No other classmates have ever been here.

520
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,080
I'm not used to it.

521
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,560
Where is your grandma? I didn't see her.

522
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,240
She hasn't come back yet.

523
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,880
I saw a balcony when I was outside.

524
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,520
We can rehearse our play there.

525
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,320
Why are we using your room?

526
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,160
Only my room is soundproof.

527
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm afraid people will complain

528
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,640
if we do it out there.

529
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,320
You must be exaggerating.

530
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,600
Memorize the lines first.

531
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,320
We can rehearse together later.

532
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,640
Sure.

533
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,960
Let me give you the scripts.

534
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,280
I only have two copies.

535
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,800
I have a copy of my own.

536
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,440
Here it is.

537
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,720
Why don't you read the highlight scene

538
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,120
where the prince
asks Cinderella for a dance?

539
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,400
We will help you with this.

540
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,400
Sure.

541
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,320
Let me...

542
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,960
"Pretty lady,

543
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,760
may I invite you to a dance?"

544
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,000
Rangrang, show some emotion.

545
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,040
You need to put in some emotion.

546
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,960
Wasn't that enough?

547
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,800
You sound shy.

548
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,760
Think of her
as someone you just fell in love with

549
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,600
and were intimate with for the first time.

550
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,720
Don't you feel happy?

551
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,960
Don't you feel excited?

552
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,720
Pretty lady,

553
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,280
may I invite you to a dance?

554
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,200
Not bad.

555
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,640
This is good. Keep it up.

556
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,560
Why me?

557
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,600
Because I only have eyes for you

558
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,240
in the ball.

559
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,320
You are so beautiful.

560
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,920
-He only has eyes for you.
-He only has eyes for you.

561
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,200
It's time to dance.

562
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,960
I think it's good to add a hug here.

563
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,080
I think it works.

564
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,960
I don't think that's good.

565
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,600
-Why?
-Have you memorized your lines?

566
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,400
Lines? I have memorized them.

567
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,480
She is your maid!

568
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,000
Sister!

569
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,280
She can help you

570
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,680
clean...

571
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,920
Do your laundry and cook.

572
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,440
Do your laundry and cook.

573
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,480
Did they clean by hand in that era?

574
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,680
Guan Fang, you have so many questions.

575
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,480
Why don't you go out
and practice on your own?

576
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,440
Come back later.

577
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,040
It's just memorizing lines.

578
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,640
I can do it in a few minutes.

579
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,040
Let's put on some music.

580
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,520
Cinderella,

581
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,840
is this your dress?

582
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,800
Look at you.

583
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,920
No, I think

584
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
I need to be more evil.

585
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,680
{\an8}Xiaofang, give me a hand.

586
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,120
{\an8}What rubbish do you have in your hands?

587
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,680
{\an8}These are fresh vegetables.

588
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,200
{\an8}They are not rubbish.

589
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
You...

590
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,800
Xiaofang, I told you many times.

591
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,480
I told you to arrange your shoes neatly

592
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,480
when you come home.

593
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,960
Look at you.

594
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,360
Tell me.

595
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,120
Am I your maid or your grandma?

596
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
You are my maid, of course.

597
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,440
How dare a maid

598
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,040
have such fantasies?

599
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,880
You!

600
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,680
You're getting worse as you grow older.

601
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,960
What did you call me? A maid?

602
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,000
-How dare you!
-Grandma, what are you doing?

603
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,160
Seriously!

604
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,520
What? What did I do?

605
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,520
What did you do?

606
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Tell me!

607
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,320
-You tell me!
-What have I done, Grandma?

608
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,320
-You!
-Stop hitting me!

609
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,160
-You tell me what is wrong with you!
-Grandma!

610
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,480
You!

611
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
It hurts!

612
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,320
It hurts!

613
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,880
Hello, Mrs. Guan.

614
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,280
Are you beating up your grandson?

615
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,200
Please continue.

616
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,880
We are just watching. Don't mind us.

617
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,840
Grandma!

618
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,400
Is it a play?

619
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,440
Yes, Grandma.

620
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,600
Think about it.

621
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,760
How would I dare to scold you?

622
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,800
We will also be performing this play

623
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,520
on a big stage later.

624
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,160
Is Xiaofang going to perform too?

625
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,240
With my ears now,

626
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,040
I don't even need props to play an elf.

627
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,360
Grandma,

628
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,200
do you want to see our performance first?

629
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,720
Yes. We don't have any audience.

630
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,680
Sure.

631
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
I've never watched a play before.

632
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,160
Come on.

633
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,240
Come.

634
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,480
Once upon a time,

635
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,800
there was a beautiful princess.

636
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,680
Her name was Cinderella.

637
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,280
Although her father had left her

638
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,200
when she was very young,

639
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,680
her mother loved her dearly.

640
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,440
One day, her mother

641
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
found her

642
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,160
a stepfather.

643
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,400
This is

644
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,640
your sister.

645
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,000
She can do your laundry, mop the floor,

646
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,920
and cook.

647
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,040
Everyone, come and bully her!

648
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,920
This is not your part yet.

649
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,720
Wait for a while.

650
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,040
Go and mop the floor!

651
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
Who do you think you are?

652
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,600
Who do you think you are?

653
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,000
It's fine.

654
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,480
Here, turn.

655
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,520
Come.

656
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Hurry up.

657
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,800
<i>Your Highness, you are such a fool!</i>

658
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,680
<i>You missed Cinderella again!</i>

659
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,640
<i>What are you doing, Rangrang?</i>

660
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
I'm reading the script.

661
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
Familiarize yourself with it then.

662
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,480
Help me record a video.

663
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,320
I'm afraid I'll forget
when I rehearse alone.

664
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,800
I want to see
what still needs improvement.

665
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,200
Sure.

666
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,560
Thank you, Rangrang.

667
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,480
<i>Look. She is your sister.</i>

668
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,280
<i>But there is no need to worry.</i>

669
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,760
<i>She can do your laundry and cook.</i>

670
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
<i>Why?</i>

671
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,920
<i>From today onward, you are our maid.</i>

672
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,480
<i>I had a very long dream that night.</i>

673
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,800
<i>The fairy tale in my dream</i>

674
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,720
<i>had a perfect ending.</i>

675
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,080
I HAD A VERY LONG DREAM THAT NIGHT

676
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,400
THE FAIRY TALE IN MY DREAM
HAD A PERFECT ENDING.
