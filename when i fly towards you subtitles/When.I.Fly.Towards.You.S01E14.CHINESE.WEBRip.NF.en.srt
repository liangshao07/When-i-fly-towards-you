00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

3
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,040
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

4
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,080
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,920
<i>So Rangrang Likes Sunflowers.</i>

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,520
{\an8}WHISPERS OF THE MOON
ARE FOUND IN THE STRINGS

7
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,440
{\an8}-Hello.
-Hello.

8
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,080
{\an8}-Zhang Lurang said he was on the way.
-Thank you for coming.

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,120
{\an8}Please go on inside.

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,720
{\an8}But their seats are quite far from ours.

11
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,520
Jiang Jia said she was almost here.

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,000
Why isn't she...

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,480
Who are you?

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,800
Give me back Jiang Jia.

15
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,560
Why are you dressed so formally?

16
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,360
Are we dressed too casually?

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,520
It will do.

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
It's almost time.

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
Let's go inside.

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,960
Okay.

21
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,479
You guys go ahead.

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm going to say hello.

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,120
Hurry up.

24
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,200
{\an8}Gu Ran.

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,160
-Hi.
-Hello, Mr. Shen.

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,720
-Gu Ran, there you are.
-Qianyu.

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,640
JIANGYI CITY MUSIC CONCERT

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Gu Ran.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,360
When will it be Qianyu's turn?

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,320
What?

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,120
Do you know when Qianyu will perform?

32
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,520
I'm curious.

33
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,280
How did you fall for Qianyu?

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,640
At first,

35
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,120
I was attracted to the way he looked

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,960
as he concentrated on playing the guitar.

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,920
Later, after getting to know him,

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
I found out he has good grades
and an amiable character.

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,040
Do you remember that time you played ball

40
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,600
instead of seeing me home?

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,280
<i>I noticed for the first time</i>

42
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,040
<i>how long the road home was.</i>

43
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,520
<i>Thankfully, he appeared.</i>

44
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,640
I'll give you a ride home.

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,480
<i>I never knew</i>

46
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,120
<i>anyone could be so gentle.</i>

47
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,200
That day we saw the sunset together.

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,080
<i>I never saw another sunset
as beautiful again.</i>

49
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,080
<i>Perhaps</i>

50
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,760
<i>only when I'm with Qianyu</i>

51
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,080
will I get butterflies in my stomach.

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,480
JIANGYI CITY MUSIC CONCERT

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,279
<i>Wait here for me for a bit.</i>

54
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,399
What is he going to buy?

55
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,440
Jiang Jia!

56
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,240
JIANGYI CITY MUSIC CONCERT

57
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,160
Where did they go?

58
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,960
Qianyu.

59
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,600
{\an8}Thank you. How about a picture together?

60
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,600
{\an8}Okay, thanks.

61
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,320
Go on.

62
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,760
Do I look good?

63
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,760
Yes.

64
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,840
Jiang Jia.

65
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,800
Qianyu.

66
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,600
Congratulations
on a successful performance.

67
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Thank you.

68
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,880
After you go abroad,

69
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,080
I don't know when we'll meet again.

70
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
I'm not good with words.

71
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,040
So...

72
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,120
I wrote something for you.

73
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Thank you.

74
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,560
I have a younger sister.

75
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,320
She also likes to write me letters

76
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
about things that interest her.

77
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,400
You remind me of her.

78
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,840
I don't know

79
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,600
when we will meet again.

80
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,040
I hope you do well in your studies,

81
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,280
grow up quickly,

82
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,480
and meet your Mr. Right.

83
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,720
I hope you'll continue to shine.

84
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,600
Besides a bright future,

85
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,040
I would like to wish you

86
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,520
a happy life.

87
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,200
Thank you.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,440
I just remembered.

89
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,280
I haven't fixed the typos

90
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,280
in the letter.

91
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
I'll give it to you next time.

92
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,720
Okay.

93
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,920
{\an8}Sure enough,

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,240
{\an8}if it's not meant to be yours,

95
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,640
{\an8}you can't force it.

96
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,960
Change into these.

97
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,960
Gu Ran?

98
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,200
{\an8}Why is it just you? Where are the others?

99
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,080
They're in there talking to Qianyu.

100
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,480
Was it worth it?

101
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,320
You even got blisters

102
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,960
from wearing ill-fitting shoes.

103
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
It's the price of beauty.

104
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
You know nothing.

105
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,159
Do you know
how many stars there are in the sky?

106
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,799
Stars?

107
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,120
100 million?

108
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,559
At least 200 billion.

109
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,160
But among the billions of stars,

110
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,440
no two are the same.

111
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,840
It's the same when they look at us.

112
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,840
They're probably also wondering.

113
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,960
Out of so many humans,

114
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,440
why are there no two alike?

115
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,320
You're the same.

116
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,840
The Jiang Jia I know is carefree.

117
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,080
She is unabashed

118
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,960
and always stands up for herself

119
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,600
rather than swallowing a grievance.

120
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,720
She's rough around the edges

121
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,840
and inconsiderate.

122
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,760
But

123
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,560
no matter what happens,

124
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,680
she's always cheerful and positive

125
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,880
like an idiot.

126
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,880
Must you list out my flaws like that?

127
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,760
What I mean is

128
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,840
you are you.

129
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
Although you're nowhere near perfect,

130
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,000
you're still one of a kind.

131
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
You don't have to wear ill-fitting shoes

132
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,040
and pretend to be someone you're not.

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,240
You're unique and shining bright.

134
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
So one failed confession

135
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,240
is not that big of a deal.

136
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,680
You don't have to be so dejected.

137
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,720
I'm not dejected.

138
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,480
Qianyu said I am like his younger sister.

139
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,920
To think of it,

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,520
being his sister isn't that bad.

141
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,880
Things could change in the future.

142
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,160
I have a strong heart.

143
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
Don't underestimate me.

144
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,160
Is that so?

145
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,280
Then why did you cry

146
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
when you failed the monthly math test?

147
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,400
I guess your heart isn't strong enough

148
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,560
to endure academic failures.

149
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,120
Do you have to bring that up?

150
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,600
Why are you so jolly anyway?

151
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,120
I...

152
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,720
I plan on having snacks later.

153
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,840
I can't wait.

154
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,440
If I remember correctly,

155
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,720
don't you have a class later?

156
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,760
JIANGYI AIRPORT

157
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,760
We just have to get back by 1:30 p.m.

158
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,520
But we would've been distracted in class

159
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,680
if we didn't come.

160
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,600
Where is Jiang Jia?

161
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,960
JIANGYI AIRPORT WELCOMES YOU

162
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,920
The 1,000th star represents good luck.

163
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,320
Thank you.

164
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,160
When will you come back, Qianyu?

165
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,200
At the end of the year.

166
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,840
I'll be back when it snows in Jiangyi.

167
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,560
Hopefully, you will be more mature

168
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,600
when I'm back, little brats.

169
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,280
I'm only one year younger than you.

170
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,440
And I've always been mature for my age.

171
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,680
Remember? I always
let you play with my toys.

172
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,840
You only let me have
the ones you didn't like.

173
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,040
You never concede what you really like.

174
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,240
It's almost time.

175
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,600
You guys should go.

176
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
I have to go through security.

177
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
-Let's play ball when you get back.
-Sure.

178
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,360
All the best to you.

179
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,320
I'll get going.

180
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,840
Bye.

181
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,280
Is it because I can't bear to see him go?

182
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,840
Why do I feel so anxious?

183
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,000
Isn't it because the final exam results

184
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,000
will be released later?

185
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,320
Isn't our class starting in 20 minutes?

186
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
Don't just stand there. Run!

187
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,640
-Let me see.
-Let me see.

188
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,000
-Over there.
-Where am I?

189
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,800
You scored well.

190
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,800
I really did.

191
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,520
-I'm so envious.
-Look.

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,760
ZHANG LURANG

193
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
-Where is it?
-Where is it?

194
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,880
You improved a lot.

195
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,880
Rangrang, you got 95 in English!

196
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,680
This test was incredibly hard

197
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,560
and the passing rate was only 20%.

198
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,800
This is what I just heard.

199
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,080
Despite the unbelievably difficult level,

200
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,040
someone actually scored 137 in English.

201
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,360
I think improving with each test

202
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
is amazing enough.

203
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,240
Don't compare yourself
to those crazy geniuses.

204
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Honestly, you're talking about yourself.

205
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,640
SU ZAIZAI

206
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,760
We all did pretty well on this exam.

207
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,600
Shall we go to Baichuan
for the summer break?

208
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
Baichuan?

209
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,760
Lurang,

210
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,960
it's not that I prohibit you

211
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,600
from having fun with your friends.

212
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,720
But you're entering Grade 11 soon.

213
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,840
And your grades...

214
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,480
Let's just talk about your final exam.

215
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
You only got 95 in English.

216
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
Do you know
the difference that one point makes

217
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,120
in the college entrance exam?

218
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,720
Before coming to Jiangyi,

219
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,000
you said you would study hard

220
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,480
and be more focused here.

221
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,480
Looking back,
you should've stayed in Suyang.

222
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,160
Look, the exam was difficult this time.

223
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,960
Lurang's results are considered good.

224
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,400
But regardless of the difficulty,

225
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,400
Luli's English scores

226
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,240
have never been lower than 130.

227
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't lower your own standards

228
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,680
just because the test was hard.

229
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,640
Ever since coming to Jiangyi...

230
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Ever since coming to Jiangyi,

231
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,480
I haven't done worse than before.

232
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,080
Also,

233
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,840
I'm allergic to shrimp.

234
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,720
I know that.

235
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,560
I was just distracted

236
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,000
while talking about your grades.

237
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,320
Eat something else. Try another dish.

238
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,760
Okay, now. Just eat.

239
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
The food is getting cold.

240
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,800
Actually, I think it's fine for kids

241
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,120
to go out and see the world.

242
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,880
Also, they just finished exams.

243
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,480
They must be hoping to go to Baichuan

244
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,960
to check out the university.

245
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,880
It could motivate them to do better.

246
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,040
As his uncle,

247
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,560
you shouldn't indulge him so much.

248
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,080
We'll listen to your uncle.

249
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
The train is leaving in an hour.

250
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,600
Why isn't Rangrang coming out yet?

251
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,200
Do you think he is grounded?

252
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,360
Or his parents secretly took him back

253
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
to Suyang last night.

254
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,000
We can always change our tickets

255
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,160
to Suyang.

256
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,760
The destination isn't important anyway.

257
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,040
What matters is that we are together.

258
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,640
There's no need, Zaizai. He's coming.

259
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,840
I was held up looking for my ID card.

260
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,800
Sorry about that.

261
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
An excuse. Definitely an excuse.

262
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Be honest. Were you secretly dressing up?

263
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,960
The train we're taking

264
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,120
passes not only lakes but also grassland.

265
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,000
It will be beautiful. I brought my camera.

266
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,600
Let's talk on the train. We'll be late.

267
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,200
Without further ado, let's go.

268
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,120
Go!

269
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Wait for us!

270
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,040
Over here.

271
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,560
Let me.

272
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,560
Thank you.

273
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,880
My last card.

274
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,720
Pair of eights.

275
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,720
Pair of twos!

276
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,120
Ready, three,

277
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,920
two,

278
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,920
one.

279
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,480
SUMMER TASTES OF ORANGES

280
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,760
AND SALT LIKE THE SEA BREEZE

281
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,000
-Hurry.
-I'm coming.

282
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,760
Three, two, one!

283
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,640
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

284
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,040
It's so nice to go out with friends.

285
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,720
That's handsome.

286
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,400
It doesn't matter if we're just strolling.

287
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
-It's still fun.
-What do you think? Handsome?

288
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,280
Right there. Look there.

289
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,560
Jiang Jia!

290
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,280
Your big head is blocking the view.

291
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,720
You should be grateful

292
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,840
that at least half
of the picture looks nice.

293
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
The half without you.

294
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,240
Forget it.

295
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,440
I'll take a picture of you.

296
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,200
Is this okay?

297
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,440
Can your smile be faker?

298
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,080
Your pose is...

299
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,920
You're so clumsy even when taking photos.

300
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,360
You're annoying.

301
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,960
Zaizai, let's go. I'll buy you ice cream.

302
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,080
None for him though.

303
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,560
It looks nice.

304
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,200
What's the matter?

305
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,480
My wallet is missing!

306
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,840
Is it the pink one?

307
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,200
That's the one.

308
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,200
This is bad.

309
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,600
Gu Ran's and my money was in it.

310
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,640
I just had it

311
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,360
when I was buying the candied hawthorn.

312
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,760
Where is it?

313
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,840
What should I do?

314
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,840
It's okay. Keep looking.

315
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,600
Did you leave it somewhere by mistake?

316
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,920
I don't remember.

317
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,240
Was it stolen?

318
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,720
It's okay if it was just my money.

319
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,640
But all our money was in it.

320
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,640
Don't panic.

321
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,240
We haven't gone far. I'll look for it.

322
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,480
Let's ask the stall owners along the way.

323
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,440
Maybe we'll find it.

324
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,440
Let's go.

325
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,280
Look at how pretty the moon is tonight.

326
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
It's like this.

327
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,400
We all

328
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,200
have limited memory,

329
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,600
so we should remember the good things.

330
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,920
Look at you.

331
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,960
Your long face looks ugly.

332
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,520
You look better when you smile.

333
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,840
It's my fault

334
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,160
for losing all of your money.

335
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,640
No, it's not.

336
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,000
I didn't want the hassle

337
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,000
and left it with you.

338
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,880
You did a great job already.

339
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,880
We didn't have a worry
for the past few days.

340
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,280
The money would've been long gone

341
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,200
if it were with me.

342
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,920
Yes, it's not your fault.

343
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,240
Come on. It's okay.

344
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,360
I have some money left.

345
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,640
We can share it.

346
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,360
Yes, I have some too.

347
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,800
But we planned to go

348
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,160
to the amusement park tomorrow.

349
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,520
Your money won't cover it.

350
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,240
{\an8}RECRUITING

351
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,160
We can earn the money that we lost.

352
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,160
It's not like we have a set itinerary.

353
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,400
It can be nice to try new experiences.

354
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,600
I agree.

355
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,760
I'll do it.

356
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,560
I should make up for my carelessness.

357
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,080
Yes, count me in.

358
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,560
With my good looks

359
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,800
and physique,

360
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,640
I should put them to good use.

361
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,720
So let me see.

362
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,360
SECURITY TEAM CAPTAIN, 2 PEOPLE

363
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,480
The security team captain role suits me.

364
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,160
BAICHUAN MUSIC FESTIVAL

365
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,200
Not bad. It suits you.

366
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,120
How about this?

367
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
You two can work outside.

368
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,040
How many tickets can be sold today

369
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,880
will depend on you guys.

370
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,120
That's right.

371
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,120
Right, here.

372
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,160
Take these for me.

373
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
Get more from me
once you've passed them all out.

374
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Okay?

375
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,640
Careful. Don't break it.

376
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,680
Hang on.

377
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,600
How could he not make good use

378
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,880
of my super good-looking face?

379
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,760
He wants me to cover everything up.

380
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,720
What the heck?

381
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,720
Stop complaining.

382
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,240
Guan Fang is assembling things.

383
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,080
Even Zaizai and Zhang Lurang
are doing manual labor.

384
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,720
Our job is comparatively easy.

385
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,080
Even in that costume, you look handsome.

386
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,600
"Even"?

387
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,800
So you're saying I was already handsome.

388
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,760
Be more specific.

389
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,000
Which part of me is handsome?

390
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,320
My eyes? My nose?

391
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,480
Jiang Jia, so that's what you think of me.

392
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,880
You're so annoying.

393
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,200
Put it down here.

394
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,520
Here.

395
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Thank you.

396
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,240
{\an8}Thank you, Rangrang.

397
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,680
I think we forgot to get the number signs.

398
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,840
Miss, can you go back to where we were?

399
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,600
They should be in the equipment room,

400
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,760
beside the light sticks.

401
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,640
It's just one bag and not very heavy.

402
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,960
I have to move these things quickly.

403
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,880
Okay.

404
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,040
Why don't I go?

405
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,760
If you go,

406
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,480
she will have to move your things.

407
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,760
They are too heavy for her.

408
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
It's okay.

409
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,960
I can go. It won't take long.

410
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,120
Are you two...

411
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,880
No.

412
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,120
We're just friends.

413
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,360
I haven't even said anything.

414
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,960
Eleven...

415
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,720
This should be it.

416
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,600
The third room after turning right

417
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,840
at the entrance.

418
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,480
I came in from the right.

419
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,880
So now,

420
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,880
I go this way.

421
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,920
<i>Sorry, the number you have dialed</i>

422
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,680
<i>cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

423
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,320
<i>Please try again later. Sorry.</i>

424
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,440
Why is this locked too?

425
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,080
It's okay.

426
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,080
I'll just go the other way.

427
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,760
This place is only so big.

428
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,600
I'm sure I'll find a way out.

429
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,000
Su Zaizai.

430
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,800
Rangrang, I'm so scared.

431
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,400
Come out if you dare!

432
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,120
Stop sneaking around and scaring people.

433
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,520
I'm not scared of you!

434
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Are you not scared now?

435
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,000
That's because you're here.

436
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,520
-Hello.
<i>-Hello. Can you hear me?</i>

437
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,880
<i>That's my phone.</i>

438
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
<i>Did you find it?</i>

439
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,040
<i>Where are you?</i>

440
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,760
The hallway outside the equipment room.

441
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,200
<i>I had a feeling I dropped it there.</i>

442
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,640
<i>Thank you so much, buddy.</i>

443
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,280
<i>Leave it there. I'll come get it.</i>

444
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,960
<i>How's this? I'll buy you dinner tonight.</i>

445
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,720
You don't have to.

446
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,800
Just change your ringtone.

447
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,680
Let's go.

448
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
How is she so energetic?

449
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
I can't take it anymore.

450
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,720
It's like a sauna inside the headpiece.

451
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,240
Also, I have to jump and dance.

452
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,080
I almost couldn't breathe.

453
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,760
Who asked you to jump and dance?

454
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,760
We only have to pass out all the fliers.

455
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,080
Nobody would take it if I didn't dance.

456
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,520
Watch me.

457
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,200
The fliers.

458
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,200
{\an8}You are so good at being lazy.

459
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,000
{\an8}You have no sense of professionalism.

460
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,760
But I must say it's quite effective.

461
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,720
Of course.

462
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,480
This was my idea.

463
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,680
BAICHUAN MUSIC FESTIVAL

464
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,360
This is all your earnings.

465
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,160
BAICHUAN MUSIC FESTIVAL

466
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,760
Wait a minute.

467
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,000
I calculated that it should be 355 yuan.

468
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I subtracted 30 yuan

469
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,080
because there was a complaint

470
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,360
about your work.

471
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,480
But we passed out all the fliers.

472
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,000
That's right. We did our job just fine.

473
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,680
We finished the job with half the effort.

474
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,400
-So I don't accept it.
-Me neither.

475
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,320
Someone said you two blocked the path.

476
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,960
I see.

477
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,760
Thank you.

478
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,200
We finally have money.

479
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,800
Where should we go tomorrow?

480
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,720
It feels so weird.

481
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,720
When we had no money,
we thought of earning money.

482
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,680
When we have money,

483
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,640
we can't think of what to do with it.

484
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,240
It was quite interesting though.

485
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,480
I heard them talk a lot

486
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,760
about the music festival.

487
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,760
I've never even been to one.

488
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,040
What is it?

489
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,520
<i>Do you guys want</i>

490
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,680
to buy tickets?

491
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,800
But you don't have enough money.

492
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,520
The five of you only earned enough

493
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,040
for four tickets.

494
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,960
Sir, can't you make an exception?

495
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,200
We worked so hard today

496
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,600
just to see the music festival.

497
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,280
We've never been to one.

498
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,840
That's right.

499
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,160
If we miss this one,

500
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,160
I don't know

501
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,000
when we might get another chance.

502
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,000
Many years later,

503
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,200
I will remember this day

504
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,880
when a kind man gave us a helping hand

505
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,360
when we were in need.

506
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,560
From now on,

507
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,680
you'll be my best buddy.

508
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
We can chip in 20 yuan if necessary.

509
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,720
Fine.

510
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,240
Fine, all right.

511
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,800
I know you're in a tough spot.

512
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
Here is what I can do.

513
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,720
I have some extra tickets.

514
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,880
You can have them.

515
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,080
Here.

516
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,680
Keep the change.

517
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,240
You should at least have something

518
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,680
to show for your long day of work.

519
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,480
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

520
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,160
Let's go.

521
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
-Happiness is easy to attain
-Money that I earned myself

522
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,120
-only at their age.
-just feels different!

523
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,600
I'm coming back in two days.

524
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,360
<i>We'll talk after you get home.</i>

525
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,120
<i>We planned for English tutoring lessons</i>

526
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
<i>for two months.</i>

527
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,320
<i>Now it will probably only be a month.</i>

528
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,320
<i>Luli has already gone over</i>

529
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
<i>all the Grade 12 material at home.</i>

530
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,880
<i>Lurang,</i>

531
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,920
<i>I hope you can have some sense of urgency.</i>

532
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,320
<i>Okay.</i>

533
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,160
<i>I'll pick you up at the station then.</i>

534
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,880
No need. I'll be with my friends.

535
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,360
BAICHUAN HOTEL

536
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,560
I've always thought

537
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,760
that these popsicles taste better

538
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,160
when shared.

539
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,480
Unfortunately, I don't have any siblings.

540
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,720
I used to eat the whole thing myself.

541
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,800
Rangrang, are you also an only child?

542
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,720
I have a younger brother.

543
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,280
Younger brother?

544
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,560
Do you two look alike?

545
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,960
Probably, yes.

546
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,480
Do you have similar personalities?

547
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,480
No.

548
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,600
He is nice.

549
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,360
You are nice too.

550
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,160
I mean, you're nicer.

551
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,280
Which one of you is better looking?

552
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,240
My brother.

553
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,480
No.

554
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,400
You are the most handsome.

555
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,920
You're probably the only one that says so.

556
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,960
Rangrang, look.

557
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,040
These five coins

558
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,840
are just enough for us to each have one.

559
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,120
I've never made money

560
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,640
with my own hands before.

561
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,760
I had planned

562
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,640
to bring this special coin home

563
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,120
and keep it safe.

564
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,960
But now,

565
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
I'm giving it to you.

566
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,760
You said I'm the only one

567
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,040
who thinks you are better
than your brother.

568
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,280
Not only do I think that you're better,

569
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,560
but I will also always think that way.

570
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,200
If he's worth 100 marks,

571
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,040
then you are worth 101.

572
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,280
That special extra point

573
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,920
will always be saved for you.

574
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,080
The popsicle is yummy.

575
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,920
I'll buy you one next time.

576
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,040
Okay.

577
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Pair of tens!

578
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,600
Pair of...

579
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,199
Q.

580
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,679
Pair of Ks!

581
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,639
I'm done.

582
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,280
I win again! Come here.

583
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,199
-Show me your forehead.
-This is the fifth time.

584
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,400
My forehead is swollen.

585
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,440
Come.

586
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,760
Is that it?

587
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,200
You're so biased toward her.

588
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,640
My hand slipped, so it doesn't count.

589
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,960
No way!

590
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,960
I'm so lucky.

591
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,280
Are Zaizai and Lurang back?

592
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,920
{\an8}No, it's Qianyu.

593
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,280
{\an8}He says he has nearly adjusted

594
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,600
{\an8}to living in England.

595
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,840
Qianyu?

596
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,280
{\an8}What else did he say?

597
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,880
<i>I've found the person</i>

598
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,800
<i>who is very important to me.</i>

599
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,920
{\an8}Let's continue playing.

600
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,080
{\an8}Wait, I haven't finished reading it yet.

601
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,920
Well...

602
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,440
I finished my cola. How about you guys?

603
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,680
Should I go buy some more?

604
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,240
Cola?

605
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,800
There are some in my room. I'll go get it.

606
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Jiangjiang?

607
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,960
Jiangjiang?

608
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,960
Jiangjiang.

609
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,960
What did you say?

610
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,360
What's on your mind?

611
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,520
You're totally in a daze.

612
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,480
Did Qianyu get a girlfriend?

613
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,680
So are you feeling okay?

614
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,360
I'm okay.

615
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,480
I just didn't expect it to happen so soon.

616
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,520
I guess fate often comes unannounced.

617
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,240
Let me tell you. That girl is so pretty.

618
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,000
Qianyu was smiling so happily beside her.

619
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,760
I guess

620
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,480
you did think of him as just a brother.

621
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,480
I guess so.

622
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,880
Something got into my eye.

623
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,600
Are you all right?

624
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,400
Don't rub it so hard.

625
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,320
Hold on a second, Grandma.

626
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,520
The signal isn't good here.

627
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,560
Let me try up on the rooftop.

628
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,200
Are you okay?

629
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,680
I'm better now.

630
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,040
Weren't you going to call your grandma?

631
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,200
That was quick.

632
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,400
I went to the rooftop just now.

633
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,040
But I saw Jiang Jia crying there.

634
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,200
So I came back.

635
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,080
I guess Qianyu having a girlfriend

636
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,520
is a big shock to her.

637
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,680
Is she very upset?

638
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,120
She kept rubbing her eyes.

639
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Hopefully, she'll be in a better mood

640
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,160
when we go to the music festival tomorrow.

641
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,880
-Hurry up and take a photo so I can see.
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

642
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,560
-This...
-They're so hot!

643
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,480
{\an8}BAICHUAN MUSIC FESTIVAL

644
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,760
Zaizai, look.

645
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,760
It's so pretty.

646
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,200
I think they draw those over there.

647
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,480
Come on. Let's go take a look.

648
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,160
Hello. Would you like a face painting?

649
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,120
It's quite popular.

650
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Yes.

651
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,480
What would you like me to draw?

652
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,640
Draw me a white cloud.

653
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,440
It's just like me, a free spirit.

654
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,440
I want a star.

655
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
Me too.

656
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,360
Why are you copying me?

657
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,920
There's more than one star in the sky.

658
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,080
No one is copying you.

659
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,640
Please draw me a sun.

660
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,240
My nickname is Little Sun.

661
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,920
Sun and summer are the best match.

662
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,520
What about you, Lurang?

663
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,520
A sunflower.

664
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,160
Rangrang, do you like sunflowers?

665
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,680
I never knew.

666
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,800
Come on.

667
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,520
This...

668
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,320
All right, you guys.

669
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,560
BAICHUAN MUSIC FESTIVAL

670
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
Here they come.

671
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,640
BAICHUAN MUSIC FESTIVAL

672
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,760
Welcome to the Baichuan Music Festival.

673
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,880
Are you guys ready

674
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,920
to have fun with the band today?

675
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,120
BAICHUAN MUSIC FESTIVAL

676
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,480
I wish my grandma were here.

677
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,440
She loves festivities.

678
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,960
You can tell her all about it.

679
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,320
<i>I told you the battery wasn't dead yet.</i>

680
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,520
<i>Good thing I brought extra</i>

681
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,960
<i>or we wouldn't get to record this.</i>

682
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,320
<i>You're always prepared, Zaizai.</i>

683
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,240
<i>We're at a music festival right now.</i>

684
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,960
<i>Isn't it so lively?</i>

685
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,840
{\an8}<i>It's my first time at one.</i>

686
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,240
{\an8}<i>There are so many people.</i>

687
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,440
{\an8}<i>Zaizai, the quality of your DV is awesome.</i>

688
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,200
{\an8}<i>It's giving me an oval face.</i>

689
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,360
{\an8}<i>I look so good.</i>

690
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,320
<i>Good-looking people? Here I am.</i>

691
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,040
<i>Can you not pop up out of nowhere?</i>

692
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,520
<i>Do you need another handsome guy?</i>

693
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,840
<i>Don't waste storage space.</i>

694
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,560
<i>I don't mind.</i>

695
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,320
{\an8}<i>But I must film the most handsome one.</i>

696
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,760
<i>I'll buy one when I get back.</i>

697
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,960
<i>Let's make a joint purchase.</i>

698
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,160
{\an8}<i>It turns out</i>

699
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,720
{\an8}<i>that the sunflower and the little sun</i>

700
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,440
{\an8}<i>shine for each other.</i>

701
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,360
<i>It turns out</i>

702
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,040
<i>that the sunflower and the little sun</i>

703
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,840
<i>shine for each other.</i>
