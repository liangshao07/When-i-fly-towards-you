<i>Three, two, one!</i>

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

3
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,040
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,080
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,440
<i>Go and See a Brighter Light.</i>

6
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,280
A summer market?

7
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
Yes.

8
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,920
Rangrang said there will be a market

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,560
at Haiyue Square tomorrow.

10
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,040
He said we should go together.

11
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,680
Do you think I should

12
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,640
use this chance
to confess my feelings to him?

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,640
Would it be proper?

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,520
Why wouldn't it be?

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,920
I think so too.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,280
But Zaizai,

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,080
say you confess now.

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,600
What if you and Zhang Lurang

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,000
don't go to the same university?

20
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,240
It will be four years.

21
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,960
Whatever.

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,520
Any place can be reached

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,280
by train or plane.

24
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,800
We will see each other.

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,880
I envy your courage.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,440
Zaizai,

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,360
I've always had a question for you.

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,120
Why are you so sure

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,400
that you like Zhang Lurang?

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,640
Shouldn't I know best who I like?

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,120
When he is happy,

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm happier than he is.

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,880
When he is upset, I'm also upset.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,880
With him around,

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
even math problems don't seem hard.

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,040
Once he is not around,

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,040
even a holiday feels too long.

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,640
Liking someone means caring about them.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,640
Jiangjiang,

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,240
have you felt this before?

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,240
No.

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,880
Not even with Qianyu.

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
I only thought he was amazing.

44
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,520
No matter what troubles he encounters,

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,880
he can solve them well.

46
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,760
He is nothing like someone clumsy like me,

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,800
so I idolized him.

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,680
However,

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,760
sometimes, you might not know it

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,800
when you like someone.

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,000
I read on the Internet

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,280
that your subconscious

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,640
won't lie to you.

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,080
Jiangjiang,

55
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,200
when was the last time

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,720
you felt your heart racing?

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,640
You thought of someone, didn't you?

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,240
Who is it? Do I know him?

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,240
I didn't.

60
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,560
Don't you plan to confess?

61
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
Do you know what you will say?

62
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,200
Not yet.

63
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,120
Help me pick out an outfit first.

64
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
There's no rush in deciding your outfit.

65
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,560
I think we need to create a detailed plan

66
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,200
to make sure everything goes well.

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,640
My many years of watching idol dramas

68
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,960
are finally coming to use.

69
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,880
Jiangjiang, I think I'm a little nervous.

70
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,440
Don't be.

71
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,600
Remember the points I told you.

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,920
You will succeed.

73
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,200
He's here. I'm going.

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,760
<i>First,</i>

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,000
step one.

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,440
Change the way you speak.

77
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,480
Speak softly and coquettishly.

78
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,640
Act cute.

79
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,240
Most importantly,

80
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,880
call him "dear."

81
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,840
Many guys

82
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,200
like that.

83
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,760
Rangrang, over here.

84
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,800
Have you been waiting for a long time?

85
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,360
No, I also just arrived.

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,520
Dear Rangrang, let's go.

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,720
Su Zaizai.

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Act normal.

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,800
My throat was not feeling well just now.

90
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,000
It's much better now.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,920
Let's go.

92
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,680
{\an8}SUMMER MARKET

93
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,760
<i>Step two.</i>

94
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,600
Create physical contact opportunities.

95
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,800
For example,

96
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,120
you can accidentally touch his arm

97
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,680
or fall into his embrace.

98
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,720
<i>Then you will feel</i>

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,880
<i>your heart racing.</i>

100
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,200
That was close, Rangrang.

101
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm glad you are around.

102
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,320
Are you all right?

103
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,440
How?

104
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,760
Thankfully, I reacted quickly.

105
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,680
Look at how skinny you are.

106
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,320
You could have broken something.

107
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,040
Sorry.

108
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,560
Are you all right?

109
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,080
I'm fine.

110
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,560
Let's walk on the side.

111
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,040
Okay.

112
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,360
The most important third step.

113
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,200
Signaling.

114
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,440
Even a confession requires a lead-up.

115
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,640
You need to let him know what you think.

116
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,440
Confessing after that

117
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,200
greatly increases your success rate.

118
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,480
What's wrong?

119
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Rangrang.

120
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,160
I've been very stressed recently.

121
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,720
My parents want me

122
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,840
to get married before I'm 30.

123
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,880
That means I have to get engaged at 29

124
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,840
and meet my partner's parents at 28.

125
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,480
I think dating for ten years is perfect.

126
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,040
It means I'll need to start dating at 18.

127
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,680
You'll be 19 in a few months.

128
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,160
Can you make it?

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,360
Well...

130
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,920
I think

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,160
I can accept dating for nine years.

132
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,640
Rangrang, are you an Aries?

133
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,240
The horoscope book I read yesterday said

134
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,680
that Aries and Sagittarius
are the most compatible.

135
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,000
Coincidentally, I am a Sagittarius.

136
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,760
My birthday
is based on the lunar calendar.

137
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,640
On the Gregorian calendar,

138
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,880
I'm a Pisces.

139
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,400
I don't think

140
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,360
horoscopes are that accurate.

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,840
If none of these work,

142
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,760
you will have to use the ultimate move.

143
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,800
A distant relative lost his job

144
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,760
a few days ago.

145
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,960
He'll be at the market today,

146
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,920
manning a tarot stall for a side gig.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
I already filled him in.

148
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
Bring Zhang Lurang over.

149
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,680
You will definitely succeed

150
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,000
with his help.

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,760
The horoscope is not accurate,

152
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,120
but I know someone who is really good

153
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,480
at tarot card reading.

154
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,480
Since the fireworks won't start yet,

155
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,680
let's go there first.

156
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,920
Really good at it?

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,960
That's right. He is very reliable.

158
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,240
Coming to me was the right choice.

159
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,440
I'm famous in my village

160
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,640
for tarot card reading.

161
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,760
Just last month,

162
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,880
my neighbor, Erniu, had the flu.

163
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,000
I told him he would recover within a week.

164
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,960
Do you know what happened next?

165
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
He recovered

166
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,680
in less than a week.

167
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,280
Those who have seen my ability

168
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,240
will always say

169
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,000
that I'm very accurate.

170
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,600
What is your name?

171
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,600
My name is

172
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,120
Very Accurate.

173
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,240
Since we met here,

174
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,600
it means we are fated.

175
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
How about this?

176
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,920
I'll do a simple reading for you.

177
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,760
Here.

178
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,560
{\an8}Here.

179
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,560
{\an8}Pick a card from here

180
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,840
{\an8}based on your feelings.

181
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,680
This one?

182
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,680
This is an amazing card.

183
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,320
Looking at this card, I can see

184
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,960
that you are a very lucky person.

185
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,360
You will also bring your luck

186
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,760
to the people around you,

187
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,120
especially those who are close.

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,120
Whoever becomes your boyfriend

189
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
will be very fortunate.

190
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,360
Buddy,

191
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,720
pick a card too.

192
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,800
This one.

193
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,800
This is amazing.

194
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,920
It's great.

195
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,520
Let me tell you.

196
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,480
From this card,

197
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,480
I can see

198
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,400
what your future girlfriend looks like.

199
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,200
She...

200
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,360
She...

201
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,960
She has

202
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,560
bangs and big eyes

203
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,560
and wears pink.

204
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,240
Are you able to find out

205
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,000
what her name is?

206
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,560
Of course.

207
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,120
What is your name?

208
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,680
Su Zaizai.

209
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,720
Su Zaizai.

210
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,840
Louder. I can't hear you.

211
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
Why are you looking at me?

212
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,600
Her name couldn't be Su Zaizai, could it?

213
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,160
Yes! Her name is Su Zaizai!

214
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
It's too obvious.

215
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,160
I think it's okay.

216
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,560
I've tried my best. It's up to fate.

217
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,920
Jiang Jia?

218
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,320
Why are you here too?

219
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,880
I'm meeting He Yu and the others here.

220
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,840
Gu Ran,

221
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,840
is this your friend?

222
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,200
She is my mom's colleague's daughter.

223
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,560
They were eating around here

224
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,040
and asked me to show her around.

225
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,520
We are childhood friends.

226
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,320
We only met last year.

227
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,480
Has it been so long already?

228
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,400
Miss,

229
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,560
since you are Gu Ran's friend,

230
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,000
do you know if he has anyone he likes?

231
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,960
He wouldn't tell me when I asked him.

232
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,840
-He...
-I do.

233
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,320
I have someone I like.

234
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,280
She is the person I like.

235
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,520
You can't simply say that.

236
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,840
I didn't.

237
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,560
She might not be the most outstanding

238
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,440
and likes to hop around

239
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,640
while singing out-of-tune.

240
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,960
She would become too sad to eat

241
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,920
because of a novel's bad ending.

242
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,120
When she is angry, even I can't stand her.

243
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,080
However,

244
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,640
when she smiles,

245
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,880
she is the only person I see.

246
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,160
I've made it clear to you.

247
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
Can I go now?

248
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,600
TAROT CARD READING

249
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,040
Are you going to reward me

250
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,200
for using me as a shield?

251
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,600
That was an emergency.

252
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,160
Fine.

253
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,800
What do you want? I'll give it to you.

254
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,120
I'm not that petty.

255
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,400
My friend just helped me.

256
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,760
Can you help patronize his business?

257
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,040
Your friend?

258
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,200
Who? Where did you meet him?

259
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,200
Do you know him?

260
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,800
It's a distant relative.

261
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
It's fine then.

262
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
{\an8}Let me see.

263
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,120
This...

264
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
The two of you

265
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,360
have a deep fate.

266
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,720
Look.

267
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,520
This card is The Lovers.

268
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,920
It represents a choice in love.

269
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,280
That means one of you

270
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,160
is troubled by love.

271
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,440
Do you ever stop the nonsense?

272
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,640
You even lied to me.

273
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,640
I didn't.

274
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,560
Buddy,

275
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,040
be honest with me.

276
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,600
Did Jiang Jia bribe you?

277
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,640
You're taking advantage of me.

278
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,520
I'm getting the short end of the stick!

279
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,680
I can't see that.

280
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,880
That's because you are blind!

281
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
My admirers
will be lining up in university!

282
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,320
Can any of them compare to me?

283
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,880
He Yu and the others are here. I'm going.

284
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,600
Buddy, was what you said about fate true?

285
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,640
Do you want it to be true or not?

286
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,360
Never mind. Forget it.

287
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,880
I shouldn't have taken it seriously.

288
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,840
I wish you good business.

289
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,880
Thank you.

290
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,800
Why did that sound like a curse?

291
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Really?

292
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,400
What if he confesses to you?

293
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,080
I don't think I will accept it.

294
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,080
What about you?

295
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,800
If a close friend confesses to you,

296
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,080
what would you do?

297
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
I won't date a close friend either.

298
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,560
I think it's not easy being friends.

299
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,400
What if something happens

300
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
after we start dating?

301
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,920
It'll be awkward
if we can't be friends anymore.

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,080
You are right.

303
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,000
Gu Ran.

304
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,960
What a coincidence.

305
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,560
You can buy us ice cream.

306
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Let me say this first.

307
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,720
I'm only treating Fu Yao and the others.

308
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,200
You got lucky to be here.

309
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,360
You're so petty.

310
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,040
There are no clouds tonight.

311
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,680
I'm sure the fireworks will be pretty.

312
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,320
It should be a while
until the fireworks display.

313
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,600
Let's play a game.

314
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,560
Sure.

315
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,760
There's a game going viral online.

316
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,160
Let me give you a test.

317
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,480
The rule is simple.

318
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Use three words to form a sentence.

319
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,080
All right.

320
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
First challenge.

321
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,680
"Su Zaizai,"

322
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,720
"Susu," and "cute."

323
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,120
"Su Zaizai

324
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,560
is jealous that Susu is cuter than her."

325
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,440
What?

326
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,440
It should obviously be,

327
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,160
"Su Zaizai is cuter than Susu."

328
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,200
You could also say,

329
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,200
"Su Zaizai is

330
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,440
just as cute as Susu."

331
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,800
Second challenge.

332
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,240
"Every day," "see," and "cake."

333
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,000
"If you eat cake every day,

334
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,520
you will see the doctor."

335
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,920
You are not wrong.

336
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,080
But the first sentence I think of is,

337
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,240
"Seeing you every day

338
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,120
is as sweet as eating cake."

339
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
Third challenge.

340
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,320
"Susu," "jelly," and "angry."

341
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,040
"Susu

342
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,360
ate my jelly,

343
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,800
so I'm angry."

344
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,560
You are so petty.

345
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,640
Wait, I keep making the challenges.

346
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,800
You should come up with one.

347
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,520
But let me warn you.

348
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,040
I'm really good at this game.

349
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,240
You can give me a difficult one.

350
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,480
"Zhang Lurang,"

351
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,440
"like,"

352
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,920
"Su Zaizai."

353
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,800
Do you think

354
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,079
I have always been confident

355
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,480
in everything I do?

356
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,880
Yes.

357
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,800
That's not entirely true.

358
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,640
For example,

359
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,200
when I confess this to you.

360
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,480
Confess what?

361
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I like you.

362
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,240
I think we can check our scores tomorrow.

363
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,520
Are you nervous?

364
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,120
Nervous?

365
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,000
What is there to be nervous about?

366
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,160
It's just dating.

367
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,640
I'm talking about

368
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,560
checking our scores.

369
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,320
I don't think there should be a problem.

370
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,440
Don't you usually have a lot to say?

371
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,560
Why are you

372
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,840
so quiet today?

373
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,920
I usually don't speak much.

374
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,800
I remember there is a food street

375
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,040
behind East China University

376
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,440
that is quite famous.

377
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,880
It's worth checking out.

378
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,320
Let's go together.

379
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,440
I'm in a relationship with Rangrang!

380
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm not dreaming, am I?

381
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,000
Calm down, Su Zaizai.

382
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,800
Isn't this normal?

383
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,960
Don't be so excited.

384
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm sure Rangrang is incredibly calm.

385
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,240
<i>Rangrang, are you asleep?</i>

386
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,600
Lurang, pour me a glass too.

387
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,520
Lurang.

388
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Lurang!

389
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,320
Why are you so happy?

390
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,720
Did something happy happen to you?

391
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,560
Water!

392
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,120
<i>Rangrang, are you asleep?</i>

393
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,440
<i>I don't think</i>

394
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
<i>I can sleep.</i>

395
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,120
What time is it?

396
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,760
There are ten seconds to go.

397
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,040
Seven, six,

398
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,320
five, four,

399
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,520
three, two, one.

400
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,000
-You can check it now. Hurry.
-Hurry.

401
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,920
SU ZAIZAI'S TOTAL SCORE, 586

402
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,360
I got 586!

403
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,040
Dad, I've never scored so high!

404
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,520
Mom, pinch me! Quickly!

405
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,720
No need for pinching.

406
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,920
My daughter is the best!

407
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,880
I must call your homeroom teacher.

408
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,640
He asked about your results this morning.

409
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,160
I'll buy groceries.

410
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,200
We'll celebrate tonight.

411
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,640
<i>Rangrang, I can go
to East China University!</i>

412
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,760
Did Rangrang get a bad score?

413
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,720
<i>I'm downstairs.</i>

414
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,120
Rangrang!

415
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,840
Did you check your results too?

416
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,480
I thought about it.

417
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,640
Which university we go to

418
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,640
isn't that important.

419
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,680
The distance is not a problem.

420
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,600
I can...

421
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,520
I think the boys' dorm and girls' dorm

422
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,480
aren't that far apart.

423
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,840
Rangrang!

424
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,040
Your four years at university

425
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,160
are all mine.

426
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,280
Zhang Lurang,

427
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,480
what do you think about that?

428
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,520
I'm honored.

429
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,320
Before school starts, I'll write down
all the things I want to do with you

430
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,240
and complete them one by one.

431
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,200
What is the first thing?

432
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Watch the sunrise.

433
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,240
We don't have to wait for school to start.

434
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,200
Let's go together.

435
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,680
Watch the sunrise.

436
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
No.

437
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,440
A date between two people.

438
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,920
This is the perfect time.

439
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,720
We might even be able to rent a good tent.

440
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,680
Let's go.

441
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,960
Well...

442
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,040
What's wrong?

443
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,760
Hurry!

444
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,000
Help me put together the lamp.

445
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,120
How can you camp without this?

446
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,600
Gu...

447
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,200
Gu Ran?

448
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,960
When did you develop a stutter?

449
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,480
He happened to come to my house

450
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,800
and saw me packing.

451
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,320
I knew you wanted to give us a surprise,

452
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,880
but advance notice is better

453
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,080
when it comes to camping,

454
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,240
so we can prepare properly.

455
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,160
Did you say "us"?

456
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,800
Zaizai!

457
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,880
When Gu Ran told me,

458
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,200
I knew he would spoil your plan.

459
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,240
It's okay. I'm here. I'll get rid of him.

460
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,960
What a relief.

461
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,240
Let's go then.

462
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,480
Hold on. We're waiting on someone.

463
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,240
If I hadn't come,

464
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,240
all of you would have suffered.

465
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,040
{\an8}Don't move.

466
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,240
{\an8}-What are you looking at?
-Be still.

467
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,720
Tell me.

468
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,720
How can anyone be so blind?

469
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,320
Here you go.

470
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,360
Gu Ran.

471
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,320
I need help here. Come and help me.

472
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,480
As expected,

473
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,280
with great power
comes great responsibility.

474
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,360
I'm going there.

475
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,400
Call me if you need me.

476
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,600
{\an8}I'm not in a bad mood.

477
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,560
{\an8}I just want to make you happy.

478
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,320
Are we going to look at the stars tonight?

479
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,920
Sure.

480
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,560
I didn't expect the stars here
to be so pretty.

481
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,800
Why didn't I ever realize
the stars were so big?

482
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,280
Gu Ran.

483
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,480
Jiang Jia? Are you here to stargaze too?

484
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,440
<i>You look like a star yourself.</i>

485
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,280
I just realized my lamp is broken.

486
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,680
I'm sure you can fix it

487
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,720
since you are so great.

488
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,520
You have a good taste.

489
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,600
Lead the way,

490
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,560
Xiaojiazi.

491
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,080
It's my first time

492
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,120
finding Gu Ran so annoying.

493
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,200
{\an8}I'm surprised. You can actually fix it.

494
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,440
{\an8}There is plenty that you don't know.

495
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,760
Well?

496
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,200
Don't you find me handsome now?

497
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,280
How narcissistic.

498
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,080
Give me that.

499
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,400
Your hair is messy.

500
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,480
When I'm not around in the future,

501
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,600
who will help you when you're so clumsy?

502
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,200
You won't be going too far anyway.

503
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,360
I'm going abroad.

504
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,960
Even if you are going abroad...

505
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,920
Is this another joke?

506
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,360
This is not funny.

507
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,720
No.

508
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080
I discussed it with my parents

509
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,240
for a long time.

510
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,280
This foreign exchange opportunity
is very important.

511
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,960
I want to check it out.

512
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,840
Then

513
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,120
that's great.

514
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,400
Then

515
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,560
have you told Zhang Lurang and the others?

516
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,440
Not yet.

517
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,400
Maybe in a few days.

518
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,200
I'm sure they will be shocked

519
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,360
when they find out.

520
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,800
{\an8}Slow down.

521
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,440
What's up?

522
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,360
I'm so happy.

523
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,920
It feels a bit unreal.

524
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
You can't escape if I hold your hand.

525
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,600
This is more reassuring.

526
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,800
Don't.

527
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,000
Aren't you cold?

528
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,880
This development is too fast.

529
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,000
It's like a dream.

530
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,680
Su Zaizai.

531
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,520
I know you want me to act normal again.

532
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,960
Come inside.

533
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,760
My Rangrang is so smart.

534
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,680
I don't feel cold like this.

535
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,080
Is the toilet over here?

536
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,880
After I go abroad,

537
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,040
I don't know when we will meet again.

538
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,600
-I...
-Gu Ran!

539
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,640
Were you talking in secret?

540
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,920
What is it? Let me hear it too.

541
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,200
It's nothing.

542
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,680
Gu Ran was helping me fix the lamp.

543
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,040
What's up?

544
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,800
What did I want to tell you?

545
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,520
That's right!

546
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,400
Let me tell you.

547
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,520
Something is wrong with this place.

548
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,720
I just saw two people hugging outside.

549
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,320
When I looked more closely,

550
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,360
it looked like a person with two heads.

551
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,280
That's so scary.

552
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,400
Something is wrong indeed.

553
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,400
Something is wrong with you here.

554
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,440
Do you not believe me?

555
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,040
I saw it clearly.

556
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,600
That person

557
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,040
was wearing a black jacket.

558
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,120
It was like this one.

559
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,920
The other head

560
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,080
was a female

561
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,000
with very long hair,

562
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,280
about as long as hers.

563
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,880
I made a mistake.

564
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,360
I saw nothing.

565
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,480
I didn't see anything.

566
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,400
I made a mistake.

567
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,200
Well, it's late. Go back to sleep.

568
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,040
We need to watch the sunrise tomorrow.

569
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,000
-Yes, let's go.
-Let's go.

570
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,920
Then

571
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,160
I'm going back too.

572
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,200
Okay.

573
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,840
What's wrong with them?

574
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,840
They suffered a shock.

575
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,880
Don't you have anything to say?

576
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,320
When did it happen?

577
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,480
You even hid it

578
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,600
from me.

579
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,080
Did I?

580
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,640
You...

581
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,880
Not really.

582
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,360
You can date,

583
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,800
but you must promise me one thing.

584
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,440
You must never tell my grandma this.

585
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,400
I can foresee

586
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,000
how hard it will be for me to date.

587
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,840
If my grandma
finds out you have a girlfriend now,

588
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,280
she will be disappointed with me

589
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,560
and torture me more.

590
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,120
I'm serious about this.

591
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,920
Why are you playing on your phone?

592
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,360
I'm telling her good night.

593
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
I can't continue this conversation
for a second more.

594
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
<i>I'm going abroad.</i>

595
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,320
Is this another joke?

596
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,639
This is not funny.

597
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,080
No.

598
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,360
I discussed it with my parents

599
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,560
for a long time.

600
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,080
This foreign exchange opportunity
is very important.

601
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
I want to check it out.

602
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,120
It's my first time waking up so early

603
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,400
just to watch the sunrise.

604
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,920
I suddenly realized

605
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,960
that we've seen many sunsets before.

606
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,520
Now we've watched the sunrise today.

607
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Are we ending what we started?

608
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,320
Touch wood.

609
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,080
We still have a long way to go.

610
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,040
This is not the end.

611
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,720
You are right.

612
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,760
It's not over yet.

613
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,720
The exam results are out.

614
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,400
Have you decided on your schools?

615
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,400
Both of us applied
for East China University.

616
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,560
So you've been planning it.

617
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,320
What about you?

618
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
Me?

619
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,080
Do you remember Yong'an?
We visited before.

620
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,640
I'll be there for four years.

621
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,160
Way to go.

622
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,360
Yong'an University is famous

623
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,600
for its economics program.

624
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,200
Of course. Who do you think I am?

625
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,320
Seriously!

626
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,280
The sun is coming out.

627
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,400
This is great.

628
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,640
We all have our own goals

629
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,440
and directions to work hard toward.

630
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,560
I hope the next time
we watch the sunrise together,

631
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,880
we will have become better people.

632
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,280
We will.

633
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,640
The next time we meet,

634
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,200
we'll say, "It has been a long time!"

635
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,920
Go farther

636
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,760
and see a brighter light!

637
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,320
The sunrise is so beautiful!

638
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,120
TO JIANG JIA

639
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
<i>You didn't expect me
to write you a letter, did you?</i>

640
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,040
<i>I'm surprised too.</i>

641
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,120
<i>It's obvious</i>

642
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,560
<i>how difficult it is for someone</i>

643
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,160
<i>who is bad at literature to write this,</i>

644
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,440
<i>so don't laugh at me.</i>

645
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,360
<i>Let me guess.</i>

646
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,600
<i>When you are reading this,</i>

647
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,080
<i>you should be preparing
your dorm living necessities.</i>

648
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,000
<i>As for me,</i>

649
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,480
<i>I should be at the airport already.</i>

650
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,560
<i>I didn't tell any of you</i>

651
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,120
<i>because I was afraid that when I saw you...</i>

652
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,240
<i>I was afraid that when I saw you guys,</i>

653
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,680
<i>I would be reluctant to leave.</i>

654
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,920
<i>But you're different.</i>

655
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,200
<i>You are so smart.</i>

656
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,520
<i>When they get mad,</i>

657
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,840
<i>you can help me calm them down.</i>

658
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,920
<i>I picked up a quote from a movie
a few days ago.</i>

659
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,640
<i>"All encounters in life</i>

660
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,320
<i>are reunions after a long time apart.</i>

661
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,440
<i>To put it simply,</i>

662
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,800
<i>when I first met you guys,</i>

663
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,440
<i>I knew we would get along well.</i>

664
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,120
<i>My intuition has been proven</i>

665
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,600
<i>to be spot-on.</i>

666
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,480
<i>I remember when we got punished together
during military training,</i>

667
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,200
<i>the trash that we searched together,</i>

668
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,160
{\an8}<i>the sunrises, sunsets, fireworks, and snow</i>

669
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,080
{\an8}<i>that we watched together,</i>

670
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,880
<i>and three years of wishing each other
a Happy New Year.</i>

671
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,880
<i>I'm happy that all of you
were part of my youth,</i>

672
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,440
<i>but there is a saying.</i>

673
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,080
{\an8}<i>"Life is like a train journey.</i>

674
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,240
<i>Someone will get off at the station."</i>

675
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,360
<i>Guan Fang chose economics.</i>

676
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,280
<i>You're determined to study journalism.</i>

677
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,880
<i>Su Zaizai and Lurang are finally together.</i>

678
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,240
<i>It's so great.</i>

679
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,280
<i>I believe everyone will one day</i>

680
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,720
<i>meet somewhere higher in the future.</i>

681
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,680
<i>I'm not worried about everyone else.</i>

682
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,520
<i>I just think</i>

683
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,200
<i>that you may look fearless,</i>

684
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,320
<i>but you are quite timid sometimes.</i>

685
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,160
<i>I'm sure you're very nervous
now that you're alone.</i>

686
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,680
<i>Do you still remember what I said?</i>

687
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,040
Just go.

688
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,200
It's pretty dark up ahead.

689
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,040
If you are afraid, you can call my name.

690
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,800
My name will give you power.

691
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,400
<i>I hope my best friends</i>

692
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,840
<i>will be safe and happy,</i>

693
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,160
<i>eat well, drink well,</i>

694
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,080
<i>always get a good night's sleep,</i>

695
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,400
<i>have plenty of choices,</i>

696
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,280
<i>and meet friendly people.</i>

697
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,520
<i>Even if we are miles apart,</i>

698
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,120
<i>we will still shine brightly</i>

699
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,600
<i>when we don't see each other.</i>

700
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,320
TO JIANG JIA

701
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,840
<i>Writing so much is not easy for me.</i>

702
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,360
<i>That's all.</i>

703
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,440
<i>If I write more,</i>

704
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,480
<i>I might not bring myself to leave.</i>

705
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,240
<i>Finally, let me confirm this again.</i>

706
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,720
<i>No matter where I am,</i>

707
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,840
<i>we will always be
each other's most important person, right?</i>

708
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,960
<i>Are you taking it back?</i>

709
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,320
<i>No, it just needs an update.</i>

710
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,280
After all,

711
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,480
I'm no longer your teacher, Ms. Su Zaizai.

712
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,400
<i>Congratulations to Rangrang</i>

713
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,360
<i>on having a girlfriend.</i>

714
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,360
<i>I hope you'll cherish her</i>

715
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,880
<i>and keep up the good work.</i>

716
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,560
<i>Su Zaizai is pretty, generous,</i>

717
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,840
<i>positive, and cute.</i>

718
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,400
<i>She is the one and only</i>

719
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,720
<i>for Zhang Lurang.</i>

720
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,080
<i>Rangrang, you are blushing.</i>

721
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,800
<i>I'm not.</i>

722
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,480
<i>You clearly are.</i>

723
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,400
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

724
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,560
<i>See for yourself.</i>

725
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,880
<i>You are blushing.</i>

726
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,000
<i>Blushing.</i>

727
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,320
Look at you.

728
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,600
You are blushing.

729
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,240
You're blushing.

730
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,160
<i>I really envy Rangrang</i>

731
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,840
<i>for having such a great girlfriend.</i>

732
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,960
<i>Of course, it's all thanks to me.</i>
