-Kiss!

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,280
<i>Copy and Paste, I've Learned It.</i>

6
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,760
WELCOME TO EAST CHINA UNIVERSITY!

7
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,080
FALL ORIENTATION

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,320
WELCOME, NEW STUDENTS

9
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,080
<i>Rangrang, my parents have headed home.</i>

10
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,280
<i>I'm in the registration area.</i>

11
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,280
<i>What about you?</i>

12
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,920
<i>I am on my way to the dorm</i>

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,280
<i>after getting my student ID.</i>

14
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
<i>I'll see you tonight.</i>

15
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,480
Go straight ahead and turn right.

16
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,160
Have a great semester!

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,360
Excuse me.

18
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,680
Where do I report

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,280
to the College of Foreign Languages?

20
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,480
Are you an English major?

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,400
How did you know?

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,880
It was just a guess.

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
I didn't expect to be right.

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,160
I am a sophomore in English.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,480
I'm going to the registration area too.

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
I'll take you there.

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,720
Okay.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
-I'll get that.
-Thank you.

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Block C is just ahead.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,320
You're very lucky.

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,960
Cafeteria 3 is right outside Block C.

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,600
It's our university's best cafeteria.

33
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,640
Will there be stir-fried tomatoes
with watermelon?

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,560
What?

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,720
I saw it on the university forum

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,920
over the summer.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,920
It's said to be a disgusting dish.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,440
That's not really true.

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
However,

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
we have stir-fried pineapple
with cilantro.

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,520
I'm just kidding. It's a joke.

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,640
By the way,

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,720
is the College of Engineering dorm
also around here?

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,560
The College of Engineering?

45
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,760
I think it should be Block F.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,920
Do you have friends there?

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll let you settle in. I'll go now.

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,040
Thank you.

49
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,800
Hi, I'm Su Zaizai.

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm Zhang Xiaoxiao.

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,160
Your bed is next to mine.

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Hi, I'm Deng Qin.

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,280
I'm Chen Xin.

54
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,160
Allow me.

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,960
You all arrived so early.

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,400
It's so unfair.

57
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,480
The guy who escorted you here is so nice.

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,920
The one who accompanied me

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,760
was promoting phone cards the whole time.

60
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,480
Just be content.

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,280
I had no escort

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,760
and my luggage broke.

63
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,920
It took me half an hour

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,080
to lug my luggage here.

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,640
You're a warrior.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,480
<i>I've arrived at my dorm. What about you?</i>

67
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,280
<i>I've arrived too!</i>

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,080
<i>Rangrang, when I was walking here,</i>

69
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,840
<i>I noticed that the path
from my dorm to your dorm</i>

70
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,840
<i>is a heart shape.</i>

71
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,280
<i>East China University is different indeed.</i>

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
<i>Even the routes are thoughtfully designed.</i>

73
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,560
<i>Rangrang, which dorm are you in?</i>

74
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,400
<i>210.</i>

75
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
Gosh, you're really incredible.

76
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
My bed looks like a doghouse
no matter what I do.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,200
Zhang Lurang,

78
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,440
I saw the registration form just now.

79
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,640
Are you from Jiangyi?

80
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,280
We're from the same hometown.

81
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,720
What a coincidence.

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,120
What about you? Where are you from?

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,040
Me?

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,080
I am a local.

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,240
Just ask me if you have any questions

86
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,160
about the area.

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,520
I know all the places

88
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
for good food and fun.

89
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,520
Okay.

90
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
<i>Rangrang, go to your balcony.</i>

91
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,560
Rangrang!

92
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,120
Zhang Lurang, are you free tonight?

93
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,720
How about dinner together?

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,760
Sorry, I have a date.

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,400
I saw this on the forum over the summer.

96
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,640
Many university students

97
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,240
have mentioned this restaurant.

98
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Luckily, we came early.

99
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,720
If we had arrived any later,
we wouldn't have gotten a table.

100
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
Listen,

101
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,200
the beef noodle I ordered

102
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,480
is the signature dish here.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
Why do you seem
to know all about this place?

104
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,040
Of course.

105
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,040
Trying all the yummy food here with you

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,960
is at the top of my to-do list.

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,200
I'll get two bottles of yogurt drinks.

108
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,360
Here are your noodles. Enjoy it hot.

109
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
Thank you.

110
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,880
Luckily, they didn't add cilantro

111
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,400
or it would take forever to pick out.

112
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,280
Excuse me.

113
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,560
Would you like to have your photo taken

114
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,040
as a memento

115
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,400
for our tenth-anniversary event?

116
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,640
Okay.

117
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,200
Are you ready?

118
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,160
All right.

119
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
One,

120
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
two,

121
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,520
three.

122
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
MAYBE IT'S THE SPECIAL SOUP

123
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,200
OR THE PERSON
WHO IS PEEKING AT MY WRITING.

124
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,360
What did you write?

125
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,120
COPY AND PASTE

126
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,560
"Copy and paste."

127
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't you know it?

128
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,560
Copy and paste means

129
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,560
I agree with your actions and words.

130
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,320
Have you learned it,

131
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,360
Rangrang?

132
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,440
Rangrang, look.

133
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,960
There is a food street

134
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,160
one block over from this one.

135
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,440
A forum post recommended
a candied hawthorn shop.

136
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
I'll take you there next time.

137
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,480
But military training starts tomorrow.

138
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
I don't know when we'll get to come out.

139
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,440
That's right, Rangrang.

140
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
The next few days will be very sunny.

141
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,480
Make sure to use sunblock.

142
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,280
Otherwise, you will get a dark tan.

143
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,360
No.

144
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,320
You won't remember.

145
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,320
I've decided.

146
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,480
I'll remind you every day.

147
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,400
What happens if I get a tan?

148
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,520
If you get a tan,

149
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,280
I'll have to get a tan with you.

150
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,720
Otherwise,

151
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,880
we won't be a good match.

152
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,800
Rangrang,

153
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,920
I heard them say
that this military training

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,320
will also have a singing activity.

155
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,080
Do you remember "Secret,"
the song I wanted to sing to you

156
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,680
in our freshman year of high school?

157
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,480
It's too bad I didn't get to sing it.

158
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,440
I'll have to practice this time.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
{\an8}You were so talkative just now.

160
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
{\an8}But suddenly,

161
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
{\an8}you're so quiet.

162
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,360
I felt like you were coming closer to me,

163
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,880
so I couldn't hold back.

164
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,680
What couldn't you hold back?

165
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,760
To take advantage of you.

166
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,720
Su Zaizai,

167
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,560
I've learned that thing

168
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,920
that you mentioned today.

169
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,280
What?

170
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Copy

171
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
and paste.

172
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
<i>The first floor?</i>

173
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,480
<i>I really envy you.</i>

174
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,760
<i>Our dorm is on the fifth floor</i>

175
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,080
<i>and there is no elevator.</i>

176
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,720
<i>I think</i>

177
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,840
<i>I'll be slim</i>

178
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,400
<i>after a semester of taking the stairs.</i>

179
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,840
Isn't that great?

180
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,160
You can lose weight.

181
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,800
<i>Don't take it too far.</i>

182
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,480
By the way, I heard

183
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,240
that it has cooled down in your area.

184
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,400
It will be a nice few days

185
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,680
during your military training.

186
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
<i>It's nothing compared to what you have.</i>

187
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,360
<i>You're in the same university
as Zhang Lurang.</i>

188
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,480
<i>You must wake up laughing
from your dreams.</i>

189
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,160
<i>Copy</i>

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,480
and paste.

191
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,520
<i>Your colleges are not too far apart.</i>

192
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,720
<i>You can kiss once in a while.</i>

193
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,720
What kiss? Don't talk nonsense!

194
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,160
<i>I mean that you can visit him in person.</i>

195
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,200
<i>Zaizai, have you two made any progress?</i>

196
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,720
<i>Tell me more about it.</i>

197
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,960
My roommates are back.

198
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,280
I'll hang up now. Bye.

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,960
Zaizai,

200
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,080
are you not feeling well?

201
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Your face is so red.

202
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,800
No.

203
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,200
The air conditioning isn't on.

204
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,640
I'm a bit hot.

205
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,760
So our school does have handsome guys.

206
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,160
Look, it's the guy who escorted you.

207
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,200
All present!

208
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,000
Attention!

209
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,160
March in place!

210
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,440
One,

211
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,320
two.

212
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,800
One,

213
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,720
two.

214
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
One.

215
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,680
All present.

216
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,720
Stand still!

217
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,160
You,

218
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,200
step forward.

219
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,840
Everyone else, continue!

220
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,840
-Do it one more time.
-One!

221
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,720
Two!

222
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,080
One!

223
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,880
Two!

224
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,800
Do you realize that you're marching

225
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,960
with the same hand and foot?

226
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,760
-Sir.
-Two!

227
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,600
-Speak.
-One!

228
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,880
I can overcome it.

229
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,040
Two!

230
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,120
Every year, there are indeed
a few uncoordinated souls.

231
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,720
I didn't mean you.

232
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,640
One!

233
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Two!

234
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,880
One!

235
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,040
Two!

236
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,120
Isn't she cute?

237
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
-One!
-Yes, she is.

238
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,680
Two!

239
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,440
One!

240
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,800
I don't think you can do it yourself.

241
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,320
-Two!
-I'll get someone to help you.

242
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,680
-One!
-Xie Linnan!

243
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
One!

244
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,680
Linnan,

245
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,120
were you also under Mr. Wu last year?

246
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,560
I was also uncoordinated.

247
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,160
One!

248
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,880
He spent a week correcting my march.

249
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,200
I ended up as a flag raiser.

250
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,160
One!

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,840
Why do you think he asked me to help you?

252
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,400
He knows I have the experience.

253
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,080
Two!

254
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,760
One!

255
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,480
Your stance is very problematic.

256
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,640
Practice the fixed stance first.

257
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,280
Condition a reflex to lift your left leg

258
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,640
as you raise your right arm.

259
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,640
Hang in there.

260
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
One!

261
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,320
Two!

262
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,200
One!

263
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,640
Two!

264
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,960
One!

265
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
Two!

266
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
One!

267
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,320
Two!

268
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,520
One!

269
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,160
Good.

270
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,600
Xie Linnan is quite a good teacher.

271
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,840
Keep it up.

272
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,920
Mr. Wu,

273
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,520
the chief instructor wants a word.

274
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,160
Mr. Li asked me to inform you.

275
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,080
All right, I got it.

276
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,320
Keep practicing.

277
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,240
Here.

278
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,840
Replenish your energy.

279
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,360
I'll just have this.

280
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,520
Rangrang,

281
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,120
I finally realized what it means
for a day to feel like a year.

282
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm exhausted.

283
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,000
I wish I had jelly right now.

284
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,920
They are also milk-flavored.

285
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,680
It would be even more perfect

286
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,480
if there was chocolate cake.

287
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,640
Rangrang,

288
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,080
are you a magician?

289
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,240
Well, I also want a yogurt drink.

290
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,680
It's plain.

291
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,680
Peanut candy?

292
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,920
Mutton skewers?

293
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,360
I'll buy some now.

294
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm just kidding with you.

295
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,640
I can't eat that much.

296
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,200
Rangrang,

297
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,520
is your bag actually Doraemon's pocket?

298
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,960
Why does it have everything?

299
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,880
I didn't know what you wanted to eat,

300
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,200
so I bought all your favorites.

301
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,240
Let me see what else you have.

302
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,800
What is this?

303
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
During military training,

304
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,400
I saw that your shoes were too big,

305
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,960
so I bought you a pair of insoles.

306
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,360
This will give you more support

307
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,600
and make you more comfortable.

308
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,520
Rangrang,

309
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,760
you're the best.

310
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,400
It has only been a day

311
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,680
and my skin has gotten a shade darker.

312
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,800
Don't worry.

313
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,120
Winter will make you fair again.

314
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,560
What are you looking at?

315
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,920
The military training photos
on the online forum.

316
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,720
I spotted a few handsome guys.

317
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,360
Unfortunately, they aren't
as hot as the guys in our college.

318
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,320
My gosh, this guy is handsome.

319
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,560
He's a new student
in the College of Engineering.

320
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,280
-Let me see.
-He has the looks.

321
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,319
He will be voted
the most handsome man in school.

322
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,680
He's quite handsome.

323
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,160
He is actually...

324
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,119
He's the hot topic on the online forum.

325
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,560
There are requests for his details
on the confession board.

326
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,880
I wonder
who will win his heart in the end.

327
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,760
Actually, he and I...

328
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,400
He's such a perfect guy.

329
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,800
If anyone in our dorm can win his heart,

330
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll buy her milk tea for a month.

331
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,960
Me!

332
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,920
I can do it.

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,240
I want strawberry milk tea.

334
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,320
Young girl,

335
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,320
you're too young.

336
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,800
Don't say such words so hastily.

337
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,040
Get the milk tea ready.

338
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,000
Watch me in action.

339
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,040
Everyone, rest in place.

340
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,640
CONSTANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT,
RESPONSIBILITY TO ALL

341
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,080
-Go.
-Go quickly.

342
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,520
Zhang Lurang, go for it!

343
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,920
Zhang Lurang, go for it!

344
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,120
Zhang Lurang!

345
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Su Zaizai.

346
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,480
Play along for a month of milk tea.

347
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,800
Zaizai should be at the dorm.

348
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,880
I'll get a bottle for her.

349
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,040
-Hi, I'll have a ham sandwich.
-I'll have a ham sandwich.

350
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,920
Sorry, there is only one sandwich left.

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,400
I came first. Give it to me.

352
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,400
Why? I ordered it first. Give it to me.

353
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
I was going to buy this.

354
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,320
I just went to get something else.

355
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,440
Then it's your fault
for going in the wrong order.

356
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
There's a saying,

357
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,800
"The order of play decides the winner."

358
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,960
Here, give it to me.

359
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,960
No, give it to me.

360
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,840
Listen, I won't give in to you.

361
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,120
What is wrong with you?

362
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,080
What?

363
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,680
-No way! It's my friend.
-No way! It's my friend.

364
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,000
Did you two go to high school together?

365
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,040
So were you two a couple already?

366
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,480
I was just kidding with you guys earlier.

367
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,520
Wait.

368
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
How could you joke about this?

369
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,120
Listen, I'm very angry now.

370
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,600
Do you know
how bad it feels to be lied to?

371
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,720
Don't be angry.

372
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,760
I'll buy you milk tea.

373
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,880
Milk tea isn't enough.

374
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,760
Unless

375
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,920
you tell us more

376
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,080
about how you met

377
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,280
and how you got together.

378
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,680
I love to hear the love story
of a good-looking couple!

379
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,960
I'll get chips.

380
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll get yogurt drinks.

381
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,320
Do I really have to share?

382
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,120
Let me think about it.

383
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,080
I first met him in the summer

384
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,680
before my freshman year of high school.

385
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,680
It was raining

386
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,000
and I was at a tiny mart.

387
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,240
He was soaking in the rain
without an umbrella

388
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,720
and I rudely called him an idiot.

389
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,800
To be honest,

390
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,760
I think it was quite romantic.

391
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,240
Later on, we got together.

392
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,680
What do you mean by that?

393
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,240
You skipped
way too many important parts of the story.

394
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,640
-Have I?
-Haven't you?

395
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,520
For example, who did the pursuing

396
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,560
and in what way?

397
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,040
And who confessed their feelings
and how did you start dating?

398
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,440
You should at least tell us these.

399
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,280
<i>Of course,</i>

400
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,320
it was me.

401
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,560
I dropped all kinds of hints

402
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,440
so many times!

403
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,840
In the end, I got lucky and got him.

404
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,800
Zaizai, you said you got lucky,

405
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,920
but I don't think so.

406
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,080
With the way you like him so passionately,

407
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,480
I think Zhang Lurang could reject anyone

408
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,120
but Su Zaizai.

409
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,720
If I were a guy, I would like you too.

410
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,440
<i>I can't be late</i>

411
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,800
on my first visit to the department.

412
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,080
Rangrang, let's have
dinner together tonight.

413
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,120
<i>All right.</i>

414
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,280
<i>I'll find you after class.</i>

415
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,240
Okay.

416
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,600
NEW MEDIA DEPARTMENT

417
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,720
-Yes, it must be published tomorrow.
-Add the effects here.

418
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,480
-Okay.
-We'll set the publish time tonight.

419
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,760
There is too much in the back.

420
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,960
-Okay.
-I'll add the materials here.

421
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,200
Linnan, a new student is here.

422
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,640
I didn't expect you
to be the first one here.

423
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,120
Linnan.

424
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,600
I'm the president
of the New Media Department.

425
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,120
She's Wu Ling, the vice president.

426
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,440
These are our members.

427
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,200
-Hello.
-Welcome.

428
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,760
Hi, everyone.

429
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,080
It's a bit chaotic, isn't it?

430
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,840
We are not usually like this.

431
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,040
Tomorrow, the school website

432
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,440
will publish a promotional video
made by our department.

433
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,240
For various reasons,

434
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,640
we're working against the clock.

435
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,480
We don't have time
to welcome our new members.

436
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,400
Is there anything I can do to help?

437
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,520
Do you know how to use Photoshop?

438
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,440
Our cover needs to be revised.

439
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,000
-I know a little.
-That's great.

440
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,200
You can use that computer.

441
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,520
I'll tell you what to edit.

442
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,280
The font looks a bit awkward.

443
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,600
Maybe it needs to be softened a bit.

444
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,080
The font size should be smaller as well.

445
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,200
<i>Rangrang,</i>

446
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,320
<i>I just left the department's classroom.</i>

447
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,480
<i>I think it's so fulfilling</i>

448
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,800
<i>to complete something with everyone.</i>

449
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,040
<i>I was afraid
I would be bored outside of class,</i>

450
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,240
<i>but I guess I was worrying too much.</i>

451
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,520
<i>Rangrang, did you also
sign up for a department?</i>

452
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,280
<i>I haven't been there yet.</i>

453
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,760
<i>Rangrang, don't you have a class now?</i>

454
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,080
<i>I can't help but reply to your messages.</i>

455
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,920
Linnan?

456
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,840
What is so important?

457
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,240
You almost ran into the lamppost.

458
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,560
I had to reply to an important message.

459
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,920
Thank you for your hard work today.

460
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,560
There's usually a welcome party
for new students on the first day.

461
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,920
But you had to go straight to work.

462
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,520
I found it quite interesting.

463
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,720
But a party is still necessary.

464
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,240
How about this? Let me buy you dinner.

465
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,800
Consider it a welcome to the department.

466
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,840
Why don't we all get together
when everyone is free?

467
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,960
The more, the merrier.

468
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,040
My roommate is still waiting for me.

469
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,520
I'll get going now. Bye.

470
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,720
What is it?

471
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,720
The university website

472
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,960
just published the promotional video
that we worked on all afternoon yesterday.

473
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,280
Many people have shared it.

474
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,160
The department president sent me the link.

475
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
Were you involved in it?

476
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,680
I only edited the cover and font,

477
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,200
but I feel a sense of accomplishment.

478
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,560
A reward for you.

479
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,240
Is that all?

480
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,560
Won't you praise me?

481
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,480
Zaizai, you're amazing.

482
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,600
Right, Rangrang.

483
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,240
I'm going to a seminar in the afternoon

484
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,480
on the East Campus.

485
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,400
Afterward, I have
two advanced English classes,

486
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,040
but I might not get back in time.

487
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,920
Can you go and save a seat for me?

488
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,720
What time?

489
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,560
It's 3:30 p.m. in Room 302.

490
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,560
Rangrang, you're the best.

491
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,280
Xie Linnan is here too.

492
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,040
Did he fail this course?

493
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,960
I don't think so.

494
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,760
He won a scholarship last semester.

495
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,280
He must be here for the credits.

496
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
<i>Can you make it back in time?</i>

497
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,120
<i>The class is about to start.</i>

498
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,320
<i>I'm stuck in traffic. I can't be sure.</i>

499
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,080
The numbers are not quite right.

500
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,960
Everyone knows my rules, right?

501
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,960
Five points for each absence from class.

502
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,520
Three absences

503
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,880
result in an automatic failure.

504
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
All right.

505
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,640
Let's start with a roll call.

506
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,840
Wang Meng.

507
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,880
Here.

508
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
-Xu Liang.
-Here.

509
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Gu Haibo.

510
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,640
Here.

511
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,160
Chen Chen.

512
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,200
Here.

513
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,080
Su Zaizai.

514
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,840
-Here.
-Here.

515
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,320
Do we have students with the same name?

516
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,640
I don't think so

517
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,320
and if I'm not mistaken,

518
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
this Su Zaizai

519
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,000
is a girl.

520
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
She is absent, isn't she?

521
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,760
I'll record it then.

522
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,240
-Jiang Jiang.
-Here.

523
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,880
-Liu Jun.
-Here.

524
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,040
Chen Meng.

525
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,760
Su Zaizai.

526
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,920
Linnan?

527
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
I'm sorry.

528
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,400
I wanted to cover you for the roll call,

529
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,880
but I didn't expect
someone else would too.

530
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,880
I messed it up for you instead.

531
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
It's okay. It's my own fault.

532
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,280
Su Zaizai.

533
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,080
Linnan, I'll get going now.

534
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,800
Let's go.

535
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,920
Rangrang,

536
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
did you answer the roll call for me?

537
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
You got marked absent

538
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,400
because another guy raised his hand too.

539
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,880
That is
the New Media Department's president.

540
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,360
He also showed me
to the dorm on my first day here.

541
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,080
It's not my fault.

542
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,000
Are you two close?

543
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,360
No.

544
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,200
Rangrang, do you feel threatened now?

545
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,600
No.

546
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,080
I have already had five points deducted

547
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,280
from my normal grade.

548
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,040
I'll be in trouble if it happens again.

549
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,640
Why don't you go to class with me

550
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,880
and supervise me from now on?

551
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,720
Aren't you afraid

552
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,000
your lovely girlfriend will be targeted?

553
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,440
Are you really not afraid?

554
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,000
I'm afraid.

555
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,200
It's clearly the answer I want to hear.

556
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,440
But when you say it,

557
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,640
why do I feel guilty

558
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,960
for having teased you?

559
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Rangrang,

560
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,640
you must have done it on purpose,

561
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,200
yet I love it.

562
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,080
ZHIMING BUILDING

563
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,120
What must come will come.

564
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,480
Who will do
the English presentation this time?

565
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,280
I did it last time.

566
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,400
The usual rules.

567
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,280
You can play slides and videos.

568
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,040
Okay. Give me your flash drive.

569
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,080
I'll take a look first.

570
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,720
<i>I think I forgot to get the flash drive</i>

571
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,080
<i>that I put in your bag last time.</i>

572
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,400
<i>Can you check if it is there?</i>

573
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,960
<i>I have it.</i>

574
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
<i>Are you in your dorm?
I'll come and get it.</i>

575
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,640
<i>I happen to be free at the moment.</i>

576
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,960
<i>I'll bring it to you.</i>

577
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,080
<i>Where are you?</i>

578
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,320
You can present from there.

579
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,880
Rangrang.

580
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,640
Hello.

581
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,560
Hi, guys.

582
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,880
The seats up front are nice. Let's go.

583
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,240
The lighting is better there.

584
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,200
Thank you.

585
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
You went to class with me last time.

586
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,280
Although I wasn't there,

587
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,480
I'll return the favor

588
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,680
and accompany you this time.

589
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,440
{\an8}Do you not have class later?

590
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,640
Aren't you doing a presentation?

591
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,400
I'll go after watching your presentation.

592
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,920
When you get back,

593
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,560
check the flash drive.

594
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,760
There is a surprise.

595
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,200
<i>This is a clip</i>

596
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,960
from the film <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>

597
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,240
that our team used as a source

598
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,360
for this presentation.

599
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,120
This concludes our presentation.

600
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,080
Thank you.

601
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,000
AUTOPLAYING NEXT VIDEO

602
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
<i>Rangrang.</i>

603
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,960
<i>Rangrang, I think I like you</i>

604
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,120
<i>a little more today than I did yesterday.</i>

605
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,000
What happened?

606
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,000
I have no idea.

607
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,120
It played automatically.

608
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,600
Why are you so quiet?

609
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,720
It's so embarrassing.

610
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,880
How can I ever face anyone again?

611
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,400
Within a day,

612
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,080
I bet the whole school will know

613
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,080
that a girl expressed her love

614
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,960
for her boyfriend in public.

615
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,480
I would rather live in a tree

616
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,000
than go to class anymore.

617
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,360
How could you laugh?

618
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I think

619
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,200
it's quite cute.

620
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
That's because you're not the one
who is embarrassed.

621
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,760
Then

622
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,960
I'll express my love for you

623
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
in class next time.

624
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,680
Really?

625
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,720
What are you laughing for?

626
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,440
I just feel

627
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,280
that I like you more today
than I did yesterday.

628
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,240
Rangrang!

629
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,920
<i>Rangrang!</i>

630
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,200
-Rangrang!
-Rangrang!

631
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,520
Su Zaizai, you have become famous.

632
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,000
I know of your heroic deeds
even when I wasn't in that class.

633
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,560
It's all over the school forum.

634
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,880
They say a girl in our school

635
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,560
played a romantic documentary in public.

636
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,640
Now our college has become famous too.

637
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,120
It was an accident.

638
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,600
I didn't know

639
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,880
the next video would automatically play.

640
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,840
How many times have you watched this?

641
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,239
At least five times.

642
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,000
Zhang Lurang, tell us the truth.

643
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,320
Did you do it on purpose today?

644
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,120
I could see it best from off-stage.

645
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,520
You were so close to the computer.

646
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,840
If you wanted to turn it off,

647
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,719
we wouldn't even hear her second sentence.

648
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,760
I was slow to react.

649
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,440
<i>Shoot. I think I really did get a tan.</i>

650
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,679
<i>I hope
the last military training of my life</i>

651
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,040
<i>will pass quickly.</i>

652
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,800
<i>Zaizai, what are you recording?</i>

653
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,800
<i>Do you mean this?</i>

654
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,800
<i>This is my diary.</i>

655
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,440
<i>I've been recording for three years now.</i>

656
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,480
<i>You're so persistent.</i>

657
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,480
<i>After all, I have the dashing Rangrang</i>

658
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,800
<i>as my motivation.</i>

659
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,120
<i>What was that?</i>

660
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,960
<i>Nothing.</i>

661
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,240
<i>That's right, Zaizai.</i>

662
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,520
<i>The counselor said</i>

663
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,280
<i>we can change our clothes and shoes
if they don't fit.</i>

664
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,880
<i>Didn't you say your shoes are too big?</i>

665
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,040
<i>Do you want to come along?</i>

666
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
<i>It's okay.</i>

667
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,960
{\an8}<i>Now, there is</i>

668
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,400
{\an8}<i>no better fit for me than these shoes.</i>

669
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,400
<i>If a person
knows another person well enough,</i>

670
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,320
<i>his love for that person
must be beyond imagination.</i>
