<i>Three, two, one!</i>

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>-Cheese!
-Cheese!</i>

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,040
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,160
{\an8}-Kiss!
-Kiss!

5
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,000
<i>Can You Come a Bit Closer?</i>

6
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,640
What the heck?

7
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,920
This is the freshmen's party,

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,040
but a senior stole the show.

9
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,680
Then why didn't you volunteer

10
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,880
to show off your talents?

11
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,840
You could've been in the limelight.

12
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
Well, I don't have any talents.

13
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,720
By the way, who is that guy?

14
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,440
Not only can he play the guitar,

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,120
but he's also good-looking.

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,920
He's posing a threat to me.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,360
His name is Shen Qianyu.

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,920
He's Grade 12, Class 6's class rep.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,960
He's also the leader of the Drama Club.

20
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,480
He can play the guitar and the piano.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,720
No wonder he's a bit more popular than me.

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,720
Zhang Lurang,

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,840
look.

24
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,080
Don't those two girls
grinning from ear to ear

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,520
look familiar to you?

26
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,480
They're Su Zaizai and Jiang Jia.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
Jiangjiang,

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
I want to leave.

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
Zaizai.

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,120
He plays the guitar so well.

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,800
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL
AFFILIATED TO JIANGYI UNIVERSITY

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,240
Why is the first class math?

33
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,280
And our homeroom teacher teaches it.

34
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,080
We saw him during military training.

35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,400
He doesn't seem very stern.

36
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,960
It's math that is scary,

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,960
not the teacher.

38
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,800
Just leafing through the textbook

39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,120
makes me sick.

40
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
He's coming.

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,840
Good morning, class.

42
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,840
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, sir.

43
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,680
This is the first class of the new term.

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,400
Although we've met a few times

45
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,000
during military training,

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,440
I would like to introduce myself first.

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,720
LIN MAO

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,680
My name is Lin Mao.

49
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,640
I teach math

50
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,520
and I will be your homeroom teacher

51
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,400
for at least the following year.

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,520
However,

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,760
I don't want you to fear me

54
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,800
like the way mice fear cats.

55
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to be friends

56
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,520
with every one of you.

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,840
Whatever you're interested in,

58
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,560
we can discuss it together.

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,680
For example, basketball.

60
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,400
I may play better than you guys.

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,680
All right, let's get back to business.

62
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,160
Now that you're in high school,

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
there are several things

64
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,880
I need you to understand.

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,960
The most important thing is diligence.

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,080
From now on,

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,640
you're high school students.

68
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,240
You need to focus on your studies.

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,000
We'll take an assessment test

70
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,120
in the first class

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
to see how good your English is.

72
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,280
Now, hand in everything irrelevant
to the test.

73
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,680
In times like this,

74
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,520
I wish I could hand myself in.

75
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,840
{\an8}GRADE 10, CLASS 9

76
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,040
All right. We'll call it a day.

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Take a break, class.

78
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,680
Hurry, go.

79
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,280
Mr. Lin,

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,120
do we have student clubs this year?

81
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,160
Student clubs?

82
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,520
There is no news about that yet.

83
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,240
When will it be decided?

84
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Wait for further notice.

85
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,560
Are student clubs canceled?

86
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,000
Didn't Mr. Lin just say
it hadn't been decided yet?

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,360
Why is it suddenly canceled?

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Right. Who told you that?

89
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,280
I heard

90
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
that it's Zhang Yan who asked

91
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,840
to have them canceled.

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,080
Who is Zhang Yan?

93
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,320
Our English teacher
and Class 1's homeroom teacher.

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,760
I see.

95
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
I heard of her before the semester began.

96
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,680
Everyone calls her

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,440
the Joy Killer.

98
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
Wherever she goes,

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,640
there are no more extracurriculars.

100
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
None.

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,120
Seriously?

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,840
No student clubs anymore?

103
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,000
<i>Class dismissed.</i>

104
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
What are you doing?

105
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
He's a top student.

106
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,480
I feel like I'm not good enough for him.

107
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,080
Maybe everyone is stupid

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,600
in his eyes.

109
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,000
You're exaggerating.

110
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,160
Su Zaizai,

111
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,320
don't you think you're obsessed with him?

112
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,720
So what?

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,800
Are you just going

114
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
to keep staring at his photo?

115
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,200
No.

116
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,880
I'll stare at him through the window

117
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
when he delivers homework,

118
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,200
in the hallway when he gets water,

119
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,160
and on the playground

120
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
when he does morning exercise.

121
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,720
Those are all different places, okay?

122
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,960
Just staring at him will get you nowhere.

123
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,160
You need to try to get to know him.

124
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,360
For example, his hobbies, interests,

125
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,960
and the type of girl he likes.

126
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,280
Maybe you can ask Gu Ran.

127
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,160
Although he has a punchable face,

128
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,040
I think he knows Zhang Lurang the best,

129
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,640
aside from Zhang Lurang himself.

130
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,080
Would he tell me?

131
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,280
Give it a try.

132
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
If he refuses to tell,

133
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,240
we'll have to bribe him with a drumstick.

134
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,080
Maybe you should wait

135
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,320
until we're alone.

136
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,520
No.

137
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,520
I can't wait.

138
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,440
Actually...

139
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,280
Go ahead.

140
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,440
Don't be shy.

141
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,800
I have a question.

142
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,800
Okay.

143
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
Well...

144
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,000
What kind of girls do guys like?

145
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,360
My kind of girl

146
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,680
has long hair,

147
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,680
small eyes, and a round face.

148
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,840
She needs to be gentle

149
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,240
and not too tall.

150
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,360
No bangs.

151
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,680
Her name should be three characters.

152
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,240
Her surname can't be Jiang.

153
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,480
I see.

154
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,400
How about Zhang Lurang?

155
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,400
You want to win over my friend first.

156
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,880
Zhang Lurang likes...

157
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
Do you think I would tell you?

158
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,280
Be honest.

159
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,320
You have no idea, right?

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,160
I guess

161
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,400
you're not that close.

162
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,360
You grew up together,

163
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,120
but he has never shared this with you.

164
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,080
You want me to prove you wrong.

165
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,400
Do you think I'll rise to the bait?

166
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,280
How naive.

167
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,320
How did it go?

168
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
Weird. He's being so weird.

169
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,920
Did he not tell you?

170
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,960
As dumb as he is,

171
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,679
he actually didn't fall for my trick.

172
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,799
This is so odd.

173
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,440
What's more,

174
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,280
how does he manage to be so obnoxious?

175
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,760
It's fine.

176
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,520
I can ask him myself.

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,960
It won't be the first time

178
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,559
I've put my foot in my mouth with him.

179
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,520
I'm used to it.

180
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,800
Shen Qianyu.

181
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,160
I can't even enjoy my food.

182
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,600
Why?

183
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,600
What happened?

184
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
It's tiring to be popular.

185
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,880
It's nothing. I'm used to it.

186
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,920
I agree.

187
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm used to it too.

188
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,920
Lurang,

189
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
I need to ask you an important question.

190
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,360
What...

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What is your type?

192
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
What?

193
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,640
I mean,

194
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,800
what is your ideal girlfriend like?

195
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,680
Girlfriend?

196
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,320
I can answer that.

197
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,240
I'll be happy just looking at her

198
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,800
and want to spend every day with her.

199
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,000
Even if we do nothing when we're together,

200
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,640
all your worries will be gone.

201
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
-I don't have a type.
-Impossible.

202
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,840
You must have a type.

203
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,800
Think carefully.

204
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,640
How about now?

205
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,800
I don't have a type.

206
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,840
That's impossible.

207
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,520
You're not being honest with us.

208
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,960
Aren't we friends?

209
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,360
Why won't you tell us?

210
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
Spill it.

211
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,600
Tell us.

212
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,880
-Say it.
-Tell us.

213
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
My type?

214
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,880
A girl that stays by my side every day.

215
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,680
Fine, I have a type.

216
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,720
Tell us.

217
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,280
She has glossy hair.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,160
Glossy hair.

219
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,160
Her eyes are big and round.

220
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
She always looks very smart.

221
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,000
Girls with big eyes.

222
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,200
And has good grades.

223
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,600
Most of the time,

224
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,120
<i>she has a big appetite.</i>

225
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,520
{\an8}A big appetite?

226
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I see.

227
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,320
She needs to be a foodie.

228
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,400
<i>And she likes sports.</i>

229
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,640
Passionate

230
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,840
and upbeat?

231
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,760
She's very needy

232
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,960
and loves to follow me around.

233
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,760
Is that really what Zhang Lurang said?

234
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,920
<i>Yes.</i>

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,760
<i>Both Gu Ran and Guan Fang confirmed it.</i>

236
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,440
I think he was basically describing me.

237
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,520
Jiangjiang, I have to go.

238
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,960
I have something important to do.

239
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,360
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

240
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,160
I'll become Rangrang's type.

241
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
Are you sure you want to do this?

242
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,360
My hair is glossy.

243
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,520
I already fit the first criterion.

244
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,520
So I'll move on to the second one.

245
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,400
{\an8}I need to make him think that I'm smart.

246
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
He's coming.

247
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,400
Su Zaizai,

248
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
do you understand

249
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,440
what the teacher taught us yesterday?

250
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,840
Yes, I got it right away.

251
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,760
By the way,

252
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,080
as for the problem we discussed yesterday,

253
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,520
I think this is the answer.

254
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,040
The braking process of the car

255
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,680
is a uniformly decelerated linear motion.

256
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,400
Given the initial velocity

257
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,920
and braking distance,

258
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,320
we can know that the answer

259
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
is 12 m/s.

260
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,800
Well? How did I do?

261
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,320
How long did you spend
memorizing that question?

262
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,280
It took me half an hour last night.

263
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,600
Although I'm bad at physics,

264
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,800
I'm sure

265
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,160
that when you said the answer,

266
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,000
you got the unit of acceleration wrong.

267
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,280
You said meter per second.

268
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,760
So what is the correct unit?

269
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,280
Meter per second squared.

270
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,960
This is embarrassing, Jiangjiang.

271
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,200
Let's take a detour back.

272
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,600
Are you giving up?

273
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,480
It's fine.

274
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,120
I'll move on to the next criterion.

275
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,760
What a coincidence, Rangrang.

276
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,240
<i>Are my eyes big and round enough?</i>

277
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,360
What a coincidence, Rangrang.

278
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,200
Look, I didn't ride my bike today.

279
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,360
I'm going to jog home.

280
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,720
Jog home?

281
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,720
Yes.

282
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,320
I really love working out.

283
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,840
I love sports so much

284
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,040
that I can't sleep if I haven't exercised.

285
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,600
Okay, keep running.

286
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,600
I'll wait for the bus.

287
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,760
Rangrang, do you need company?

288
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,440
If you do, just say the word.

289
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,880
No, thank you.

290
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Aren't you going to jog?

291
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,440
I can jog every day,

292
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,560
but I don't get
to go home with you every day.

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
Rangrang,

294
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,000
do you take this bus every day?

295
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,960
Yes.

296
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,400
I take this bus home too.

297
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,680
Where do you get off?

298
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,520
It's far away.

299
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,240
How many stops away is that?

300
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,400
Five?

301
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,400
Six?

302
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,320
Su Zaizai.

303
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,720
Be quiet.

304
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,920
Okay.

305
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,720
Rangrang,

306
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,920
we know each other now.

307
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,840
What do you know about me

308
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,960
other than my name?

309
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,480
It's fine if you don't know anything.

310
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,280
Let me officially introduce myself.

311
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,880
I have

312
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,280
big round eyes

313
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,080
and glossy hair.

314
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,240
I eat a lot and love sports.

315
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,440
My type?

316
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,840
A girl that stays by my side every day.

317
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,080
Tell us.

318
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,600
She has glossy hair.

319
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm very smart too.

320
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,920
Most importantly,

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,120
I'm needy.

322
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm very needy.

323
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,880
I love to follow people around.

324
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,000
What are you looking at?

325
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,960
My girl.

326
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,080
Do you already have one?

327
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,120
Don't you think

328
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,520
you're too young for that?

329
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,240
So when you described your type,

330
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,280
you were talking about your pet?

331
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,520
Her eyes are big, right?

332
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,760
Yes.

333
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,280
Big and round.

334
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,080
<i>His pet?</i>

335
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes. She's a golden retriever.

336
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,040
<i>I knew we couldn't count on Gu Ran.</i>

337
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,040
In just a few days,

338
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,600
I've made a complete fool of myself.

339
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,280
<i>Don't be upset.</i>

340
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,320
I'm not upset.

341
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,440
I'm full of regret.

342
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,960
<i>We still have student clubs.</i>

343
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,520
<i>You're not in the same class,</i>

344
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
<i>but if you are in the same club,</i>

345
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,120
<i>you'll get a lot of chances to see him.</i>

346
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,440
<i>It's not too late to rebuild your image.</i>

347
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
You're right.

348
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,560
But I heard

349
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,720
that the clubs might get canceled.

350
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,200
A meeting will be held to decide that.

351
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,520
I'm so frustrated.

352
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,200
Okay, let's call it a day.

353
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,880
Your homework is the textbook problems.

354
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,280
It's due tomorrow. Class dismissed.

355
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,319
What's wrong?

356
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,359
You all look so listless.

357
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,720
I told you

358
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,480
not to hold out hope.

359
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,079
Mr. Lin hasn't told us the result yet.

360
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
I bet the clubs have been canceled.

361
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,599
My Shen Qianyu.

362
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,920
It seems

363
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,920
that you heard the news about the clubs.

364
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,000
I didn't see it coming either.

365
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,040
Mr. Lin, is it a done deal now?

366
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,960
Yes.

367
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,600
After all,
the time for signing up has been set.

368
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,600
Canceling the clubs now

369
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,560
would be unreasonable.

370
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,000
Then can we...

371
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,640
What does that mean?

372
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,040
Sign-ups have been set,

373
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,000
so the clubs won't be canceled!

374
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,360
Great!

375
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,480
Okay, quiet down.

376
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,320
Now you're energized.

377
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,600
But I have to remind you

378
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,640
that if club participation
affects your grades,

379
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,200
they can be canceled at any time.

380
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,120
Do you understand?

381
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,800
-Yes.
-Yes.

382
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,600
Okay. Wang Nan.

383
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,200
Come with me to get the sign-up forms.

384
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,120
Sure.

385
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,000
My drama club. My Shen Qianyu.

386
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,840
My happiness is back.

387
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,240
Have you decided on Drama Club?

388
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,160
Of course.

389
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,800
Zaizai, why don't you join it with me?

390
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,520
I want to sign up

391
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,160
for the same club as Zhang Lurang.

392
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,200
But I feel that Zhang Lurang is too aloof

393
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,520
to join any club.

394
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
No, he's not aloof at all.

395
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,160
He just doesn't talk much.

396
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,600
Are you asking me
which club Zhang Lurang will join?

397
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,160
He'll join whichever club I join.

398
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,920
You can't expect us to buy that.

399
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
I can vouch for him. He's not lying.

400
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,280
We have Zhang Lurang's sign-up form.

401
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,040
So it's true.

402
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,040
Which club are you going to sign up for?

403
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,960
Basketball.

404
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,360
Only on the basketball court

405
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,240
can we showcase our remarkable skills.

406
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,400
Basketball?

407
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,960
Playing basketball is dangerous.

408
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Could you give it a second thought?

409
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,920
A second thought?

410
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Sure.

411
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,920
However,

412
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,440
this person doubted me just now.

413
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,720
I'm upset.

414
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,640
Then what do you want?

415
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,520
How about I buy you milk tea for a month

416
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,920
if you get Zhang Lurang

417
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,240
to join the Drama Club?

418
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,400
-That's not...
-No problem!

419
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,120
But you need to specify the cup size,
frequency, and brand.

420
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,920
Let me be frank.

421
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,520
Milk tea is not enough to bribe me.

422
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,800
Just milk tea...

423
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,120
And the number
of our grade's prettiest girl.

424
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
The prettiest girl in our grade?

425
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,320
Yes, the prettiest girl in our grade.

426
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,040
Many guys want to have her number.

427
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,400
Right?

428
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,520
Why didn't you say so sooner?

429
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
Go straight to the point next time.

430
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,920
It's a deal then.

431
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,000
Here, try it.

432
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
How is it?

433
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,800
Mango pomelo sago
is our signature dessert.

434
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
It's great.

435
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,160
-It's delicious.
-I'm glad you like it.

436
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,280
I came with He Yu once.

437
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,440
It was very delicious.

438
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,480
Why are they here?

439
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,760
Why are you guys here?

440
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,040
What a dumb question.

441
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,200
This is our buddy's home.

442
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,640
Look, it's my family business.

443
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,880
Zhang Lurang, what a coincidence.

444
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,120
Are you Xiaofang's classmates too?

445
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,000
What do you want to have?

446
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,040
I'll make it for you.

447
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,680
Don't you think
it's too much of a coincidence?

448
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,600
A bit.

449
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,760
Those girls are so cunning.

450
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,000
It is a coincidence.

451
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Why are you so sure?

452
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,440
She's bad at acting.

453
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,840
Look, Guan Fang.

454
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,640
They're chatting with your grandma.

455
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,040
What are they talking about?

456
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,800
My grandma must be praising me.

457
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,040
I know her.

458
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,080
She sings my praises to everyone.

459
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,520
It's so embarrassing.

460
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,120
Guan Fang was still wetting the bed
in primary school?

461
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Yes.

462
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,840
And he insisted that it was sweat.

463
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,760
Don't you think

464
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,640
he was a silly child?

465
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,480
Grandma never knows

466
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,800
how to keep a low profile.

467
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,560
Look, they glanced at me too.

468
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,280
Listen, all elders love me.

469
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,840
Your grandma must be praising me too.

470
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,400
Yes, for sure.

471
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Lurang,

472
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,600
you need to talk more sometimes.

473
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,040
Elders don't like

474
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,640
boys like you.

475
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,680
But I think

476
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,960
that boy over there is nice.

477
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,160
He looks like a good boy.

478
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,080
I agree.

479
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,760
Rangrang, are you full?

480
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,240
Yes.

481
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,920
You didn't eat much.

482
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,200
Rangrang, are you taking the bus too?

483
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,320
Yes.

484
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
What a coincidence. Me too.

485
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,720
Didn't you say you love sports?

486
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,640
Taking the bus home with you

487
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,880
is also a kind of sport.

488
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,080
<i>Student card.</i>

489
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,640
I'll pay for you.

490
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,320
Thank you.

491
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,000
<i>Student card.</i>

492
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,800
Sir!

493
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,160
If you're not feeling well,

494
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,320
you can take my seat.

495
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Mind your own business.

496
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm not feeling unwell.

497
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,520
That's right.

498
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,360
I saw you trying to lean on that lady,

499
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,640
so I thought you had trouble standing.

500
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
When did I do that?

501
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,560
You're mistaken.

502
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,440
Didn't you see her getting

503
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,440
in my way?

504
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,400
You kept moving closer to me.

505
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,360
Yes, I saw it.

506
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,160
Young girl,

507
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,680
you can't make wild accusations.

508
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,480
There are so many passengers.

509
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Did anyone else see that?

510
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,520
Anyone?

511
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,800
Anyone at all?

512
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,240
I saw it.

513
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,520
I saw it too.

514
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,360
Yes, I saw it too.

515
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,720
You're shameless.

516
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,960
Scumbag.

517
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,920
No point in arguing with a scumbag.

518
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,680
Yes, let's just call the police.

519
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,400
-Wait, guys.
-Scumbag.

520
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,200
You're all lying!

521
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,360
I can't bother you today.

522
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,520
{\an8}Luckily this is my stop

523
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,640
{\an8}or I wouldn't let it slide.

524
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,640
{\an8}Get off!

525
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,280
Wait and see!

526
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,960
-He's embarrassing.
-He should be arrested.

527
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,280
Thank you.

528
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,520
You're welcome.

529
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,160
Weren't you afraid?

530
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,120
I was afraid.

531
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,640
I was only so brave because you're here.

532
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,280
Why?

533
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Because you would back me up.

534
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,760
I wouldn't.

535
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,640
But you did.

536
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,680
I didn't.

537
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,600
<i>We are arriving at Jiangxia Park.</i>

538
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,440
<i>Please exit from the back door.</i>

539
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
<i>The next stop is Chenyang Neighborhood.</i>

540
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,560
I'm getting off at the next stop.

541
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,800
Me too.

542
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,600
{\an8}CHENYANG NEIGHBORHOOD

543
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,200
Why are you following me?

544
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,840
I'm not. I live...

545
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,200
I live over there.

546
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,640
I'm on my way home.

547
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,240
See you tomorrow.

548
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,280
Rangrang,

549
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,200
good night.

550
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,840
Zhang Lurang,

551
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,440
did you sign up for the Drama Club too?

552
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,400
Gu Ran filled out this form
for you, right?

553
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,720
This is his handwriting.

554
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,880
What's wrong with the Drama Club?

555
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,160
It's great.

556
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,680
Everyone should sign up
for the Drama Club.

557
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,960
Don't you think so, Lurang?

558
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,360
The Drama Club?

559
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,600
We thought about it carefully and decided

560
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,560
that the Drama Club was the best.

561
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,360
Yes.

562
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,080
Playing basketball outdoors is too tiring.

563
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,440
Staying indoors is much better.

564
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,840
We don't mind getting exhausted,

565
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,080
but we can't let you suffer with us.

566
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,080
Yes.

567
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,800
Is he angry?

568
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,040
That expression usually means he gives in.

569
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,680
Something is off.

570
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,160
What is off?

571
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,600
Jiang Jia sent me
that girl's number on WeChat yesterday.

572
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,400
She still hasn't accepted
my friend request.

573
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,680
What's weirder

574
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,240
is that her profile picture is a lotus

575
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,840
and her username is Flowers in Summer.

576
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,480
That sounds like it could be my mom.

577
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,400
Don't say that.

578
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,240
She's just mature.

579
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,960
Do you think Jiang Jia fooled me?

580
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,000
No way.

581
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,240
She has no motive.

582
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,520
Her motive...

583
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,200
Why didn't it occur to me yesterday?

584
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,440
What?

585
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,680
How is it possible

586
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,480
that she would give me
another girl's number?

587
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,040
Why is that impossible?

588
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,520
She's in love with me.

589
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,040
I need to find a chance to talk to her.

590
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,080
Of course my mom didn't add him.

591
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,440
She said someone called Mr. Charming

592
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,600
kept sending her friend requests.

593
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,920
She directly rejected him.

594
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,240
I said I accidentally gave out her number

595
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,520
and she told me off.

596
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,040
She said someone with that username

597
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,200
can't be a good student.

598
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,680
What if Gu Ran finds out?

599
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,960
I don't care.

600
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,200
Getting Zhang Lurang
into the Drama Club is what matters.

601
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,320
What are you making?

602
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Paper stars.

603
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,000
I'll make a jar of stars

604
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,280
and give it to Shen Qianyu.

605
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,800
What's the use of that?

606
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,320
It's useless.

607
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,240
But it's romantic.

608
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,280
I'll be able to see Shen Qianyu

609
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
when I go to the club this afternoon.

610
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,280
He's definitely as outstanding,

611
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,280
gentle,

612
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,880
and humorous as usual.

613
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,240
This is our first club meeting.

614
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Let me introduce myself first.

615
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,600
I'm Xiao Kai,

616
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,800
your teacher in the Drama Club

617
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,120
and the teacher
of Grade 12 acting classes.

618
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,920
Where is my Shen Qianyu?

619
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,040
Zhang Lurang isn't here either.

620
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,920
Maybe he isn't coming.

621
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,920
The club is so boring

622
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,120
without him.

623
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,360
Sorry.

624
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,400
Sorry for being late.

625
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,320
Come in and take a seat.

626
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,680
Being late is better than being absent.

627
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,160
Sit.

628
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,240
Hey, Qianyu.

629
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,200
You look so happy.

630
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
I didn't know you were so into me.

631
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,640
What were you murmuring?

632
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,440
Be quiet, everyone.

633
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,920
Let me introduce someone to you.

634
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,280
The boy beside me

635
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,400
is Shen Qianyu.

636
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,000
Qianyu is

637
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,880
the president of the Drama Club.

638
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,520
Qianyu, say hi

639
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,480
to everybody.

640
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,520
Hi, everyone.

641
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,240
Clap!

642
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,440
-Clap!
-Sorry, sir. We're late.

643
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,880
Come in and take a seat.

644
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,680
Is this seat taken?

645
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,040
No.

646
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,560
{\an8}<i>Today is September 11th, 2012.</i>

647
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,040
{\an8}<i>I took the bus with Rangrang</i>

648
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
{\an8}<i>for the first time</i>

649
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
{\an8}<i>and couldn't help but secretly film it.</i>

650
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
{\an8}<i>That was close.</i>

651
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,880
{\an8}<i>I almost got caught.</i>

652
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,720
{\an8}<i>This is my sad face.</i>

653
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,440
{\an8}<i>I made a big fool of myself today.</i>

654
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,040
<i>His girl is actually...</i>

655
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,640
<i>Forget it. Tomorrow is another day.</i>

656
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,040
<i>Let bygones be bygones.</i>

657
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,320
{\an8}<i>Darn. I missed my stop!</i>

658
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,440
<i>Today, I desperately wanted
to summon Aladdin</i>

659
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,360
<i>to fulfill just one of my wishes.</i>

660
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,880
<i>I wish I could erase</i>

661
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,280
<i>Rangrang's memory of me today.</i>
