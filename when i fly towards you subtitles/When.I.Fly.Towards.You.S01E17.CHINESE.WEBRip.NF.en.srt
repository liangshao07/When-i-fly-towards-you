{\an8}ADAPTED FROM ZHU YI'S NOVEL,
SHE'S A LITTLE CRAZY, ON JJWXC.NET

<i>My Wish When I Was 17 Was About You.</i>

6
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,080
TO SU ZAIZAI, FROM ZHANG LULI

7
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,640
<i>It has been a while, Zaizai.</i>

8
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,440
{\an8}<i>I can't use my phone anymore</i>

9
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,040
{\an8}<i>as the NCEE is around the corner.</i>

10
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,720
<i>I can only write letters instead.</i>

11
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,480
<i>I was on the phone with Lurang
a while back.</i>

12
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,040
<i>He was in a good mood</i>

13
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,400
<i>and told me a lot about you guys.</i>

14
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,600
<i>I don't know anyone else.</i>

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,640
<i>But from the way he talked about them,</i>

16
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,680
<i>they must be just as interesting as you.</i>

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,120
<i>You said Lurang became friends with you</i>

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,680
<i>because you kept bothering him.</i>

19
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,800
<i>Let me tell you in secret.</i>

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,480
<i>I've seen Lurang play</i>

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,440
<i>with that toy many times.</i>

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,120
<i>He must be happy to have you as a friend,</i>

23
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,600
<i>but won't admit it.</i>

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
<i>My brother is cute in that way.</i>

25
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,560
<i>By the way,</i>

26
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,080
<i>I talked to my parents after I got back.</i>

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,280
<i>I get the feeling they're slowly changing.</i>

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,560
<i>I hope things get better.</i>

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,200
<i>Zaizai, I wish you all the best too.</i>

30
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,600
Zaizai!

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,360
You're going to be late for school!

32
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm coming!

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,240
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,000
You used to be excited about your birthday

35
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
before it even arrived.

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,120
Why don't you want to celebrate this year?

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,000
I know there are some things

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,400
that I can't avoid,

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,400
but I can't help but think about the fact

40
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,840
that my birthday
is before the winter break.

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,640
After my birthday,

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,480
Zhang Lurang will go back to Suyang.

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,800
I suddenly don't feel like celebrating it.

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,360
It's exactly because he's leaving

45
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,040
that we must enjoy your birthday

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,320
so that it's meaningful.

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,240
We must have a good time.

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,720
Come on.

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,000
This is so difficult.

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,760
What is so difficult about buying a gift?

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
Winter is coming.

52
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,280
You can buy a scarf or gloves.

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,240
Or...

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,480
Bracelets are nice too.

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,680
Most girls like pretty things.

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
Do you?

57
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,360
Are you asking that question

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,640
to mock me for not being like most girls?

59
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Forget it.

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,920
There is no use

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,080
keeping it after buying it.

62
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,880
I got this from the spicy hot pot event

63
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,160
at the canteen.

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,760
I have no use for it. You can have it.

65
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,160
No.

66
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
Knowing Jiang Jia's personality,

67
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,520
she'll wait outside the canteen tomorrow.

68
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,120
I found this on the roadside.

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm lucky, aren't I?

70
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,080
That is too fake.

71
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,960
Gu Ran.

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Guilty conscience? You look spooked.

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,600
What do you want with me at this hour?

74
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,280
Well,

75
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
it's just that

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,720
I just bought Su Zaizai's birthday gift.

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
It's one of those carved wooden dolls.

78
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Don't you know her better?

79
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,120
What do you think?

80
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,800
Sure, Zaizai will probably like it.

81
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,960
Is that all?

82
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,840
Yes. What else could there be?

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,680
By the way,

84
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,760
the store where I bought the gift

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,360
happened to have a promotion,

86
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,480
buy 2 and get 20% off,

87
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,920
so I was suckered into buying this.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have no use for it,

89
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,440
so I guess you can have it.

90
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,920
If you don't want it...

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,760
Why would I turn down something free?

92
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,680
You don't like me, do you?

93
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,400
Who did you say I like?

94
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,160
You?

95
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,320
How is that possible?

96
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,440
What is so good about you?

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,080
Besides having big eyes,

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,280
fair skin, a small face,
curly lashes, and tall,

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,640
what qualities do you possess?

100
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,160
I...

101
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,840
What I meant is that

102
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
you're not really my type.

103
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,520
Don't overthink it.

104
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,680
That is good.

105
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,680
I thought you had a thing for me.

106
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,680
That scared me.

107
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,360
Don't flatter yourself.

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,200
We finally made it to the Friday
without evening self-study.

109
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,320
We're leaving first.

110
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,960
-Bye.
-See you next week.

111
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,960
Let's go.

112
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,760
Let's go get Zhang Lurang and Gu Ran.

113
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,800
Dinner is on me today.

114
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,640
I've even decided on the restaurant.

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,600
If you're treating us,

116
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,120
we might make you broke.

117
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,200
I'm happy because it's my birthday.

118
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,680
Su Zaizai, Mr. Lin wants to see you.

119
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,280
I wonder what it is about.

120
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,160
Why don't I text you the address?

121
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,320
Head there first. I'll catch up with you.

122
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,840
Okay, then we'll leave first.

123
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,080
Okay.

124
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,760
Sir.

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,160
Mr. Lin, you wanted to see me?

126
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,000
It's no big deal.

127
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,880
Grade 10 just had their monthly exam.

128
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,040
They're eager to get their English scores.

129
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,680
I don't have enough graders,

130
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,320
so I wanted to ask for your help.

131
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,800
Grade the multiple-choice questions

132
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,200
using this answer key.

133
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,760
It won't take long.

134
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,280
Are you

135
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,240
in a hurry to leave?

136
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
I'm not in a hurry.

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,880
Okay.

138
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,120
Then you can grade at that table.

139
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,080
Here.

140
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,960
Thank you.

141
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,960
Are you done?

142
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,320
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

143
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,360
Thank you so much for today.

144
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,080
Be careful on your way home. Bye.

145
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,160
<i>It's late.</i>

146
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,600
<i>Why don't you guys go home first?</i>

147
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,040
<i>What? I guess we have no choice.</i>

148
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,840
<i>We'll celebrate your birthday tomorrow.</i>

149
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,200
<i>It's fine. We can do it anytime.</i>

150
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,840
MS. SU ZAIZAI, THE CHALLENGE BEGINS!

151
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,960
THIS WAY, PLEASE

152
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,880
COME ON, YOU'RE ALMOST THERE

153
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,400
{\an8}COME ON, YOU'RE ALMOST THERE

154
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,760
SU ZAIZAI! TURN AROUND!

155
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,960
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

156
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,600
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

157
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,000
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

158
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,880
{\an8}<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

159
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

160
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,320
Happy birthday.

161
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,520
Happy birthday.

162
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,000
I thought you all left.

163
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,800
Why would we?

164
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,160
Even if they left, I wouldn't.

165
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,800
You go too far to belittle others

166
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,440
to make yourself look good.

167
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,920
We wouldn't leave either, okay?

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,720
So? Isn't my idea better?

169
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,440
I asked Mr. Lin to delay you for a bit.

170
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,080
What do you think? Isn't it great?

171
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,960
Your gift has grown wings

172
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,080
and flown to your room.

173
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,520
This is the most important part now.

174
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
Su Zaizai, make a wish.

175
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
It's Lurang's first birthday celebration.

176
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,480
He doesn't even celebrate
his own birthday.

177
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,880
My wish is simple.

178
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,840
It's not too much
if I make two wishes, right?

179
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,080
For my first wish, I hope everyone can be

180
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,960
as happy every day as they are today.

181
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,240
What about the second wish?

182
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,320
I'm not telling you my second wish.

183
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,800
Su Zaizai, you've changed!

184
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
You can't get me!

185
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,440
Be careful!

186
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
<i>My second wish</i>

187
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,320
<i>is to spend Rangrang's 18th birthday</i>

188
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,360
<i>with him.</i>

189
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,760
Rangrang.

190
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,800
<i>Hey.</i>

191
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,480
<i>Are you free right now?</i>

192
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,480
What's up?

193
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,600
<i>Can you come downstairs?</i>

194
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,760
<i>I'm outside your house.</i>

195
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,720
Yes! I'll come down right away.

196
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,680
{\an8}Rangrang.

197
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,600
{\an8}Did you want to see me?

198
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,560
Happy birthday, Su Zaizai.

199
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,640
Your gift.

200
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,320
I think you'll like it.

201
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,960
Thank you.

202
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,680
This is my happiest birthday ever.

203
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,880
When you get back to Suyang,

204
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
I'll use it to take a lot of pictures

205
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,880
and send them to you.

206
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,320
Can you grant me a wish too?

207
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,040
What is it?

208
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,240
Will you come back

209
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,720
after I use up all the photo papers?

210
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,880
Okay.

211
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't break your word.

212
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
One by one.

213
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Don't rush, kids.

214
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,280
Why are there still so many people?

215
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,760
The school-organized ID photo session

216
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,800
is so popular.

217
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,320
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

218
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,360
Nine o'clock.

219
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,080
We'll be in class at that time.

220
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,400
We won't be able to see you off.

221
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,840
It's all right.

222
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm not going very far anyway.

223
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
I can come back during the holidays.

224
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,640
Yes, we can visit you

225
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
if you can't come.

226
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,320
Besides, a year or so isn't that long.

227
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,640
It will pass by quickly.

228
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,960
Yes, very quickly.

229
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,440
Then let's make a deal

230
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,080
to keep in touch.

231
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
It's good enough

232
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,440
if you don't harass Zhang Lurang.

233
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,800
Harass?

234
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,080
It's care.

235
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,680
-What is going on?
-I don't know.

236
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,280
Why hasn't the line moved at all?

237
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Sorry, excuse me.

238
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,840
-Excuse me.
-Watch out.

239
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,000
Is something wrong?

240
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,680
Kids.

241
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,840
Calm down, kids.

242
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,080
We're having technical issues.

243
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,360
We're getting someone to fix it.

244
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,720
It might take a while.

245
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,440
I know a bit about computers.

246
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,360
Can I take a look?

247
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,200
Sure. Come on.

248
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,640
-Can he really do it?
-I know, right?

249
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,680
All right.

250
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,240
This guy is amazing.

251
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,440
You fixed it so quickly.

252
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
It's just a hobby.

253
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,440
Gu Ran,

254
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,080
you're amazing.

255
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,920
You kept it from us.

256
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,200
I just got lucky today.

257
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,240
Why are you being humble?

258
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,760
You're really good.

259
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,880
I only use the computer to play games
and surf the Internet.

260
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,200
Yet you know how to fix it.

261
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,920
It's actually not that difficult.

262
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,080
Well,

263
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,320
my talent did most of the job.

264
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,080
All right. We can proceed.

265
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,760
Are you guys friends?

266
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,600
Yes, best friends.

267
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,080
If it weren't for this boy,

268
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,680
we might have had to wait a long time.

269
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,640
Why don't we let them
take the photos first?

270
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,600
-Sure.
-Okay.

271
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,200
Let's take your photos first.

272
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,200
Really?

273
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,000
Let's get changed
into the outfit for the photoshoot.

274
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,160
It's so cold. I'm glad the heater is on.

275
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,120
Boy, you're up first.

276
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,440
All right, sit up.

277
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,280
You're smiling so happily.

278
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,240
You're in a good mood
after fixing the computer.

279
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,280
Okay, three, two,

280
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,280
one.

281
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,760
Okay, look at the camera.

282
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,360
Three, two, one.

283
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,160
Tilt your head a little to the left.

284
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,480
Okay, three, two, one.

285
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,160
Let me see yours.

286
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,920
It looks really good.

287
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,839
Students, get your photos.

288
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,839
Okay.

289
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,960
Why do I look so creepy?

290
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,200
Let me see.

291
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,319
I want to see it too.

292
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,240
Let me take a look.

293
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,359
Let me see.

294
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,720
Where is mine?

295
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,280
What are you doing?

296
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,240
Excuse me.

297
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,319
Can we get another photo?

298
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,920
Guan Fang,

299
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,079
don't be nitpicky.

300
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,080
I meant a group photo.

301
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,040
Sure. Go on.

302
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,160
No one is left anyway.

303
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,400
No rules this time.

304
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,360
Pose however you want.

305
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,120
-Let's go.
-Go on.

306
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,360
I'm standing here.

307
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,360
Move over.

308
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,480
Don't move.

309
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,520
The boy in the middle, don't be so stiff.

310
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,960
Relax and smile.

311
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,880
You look the best when you smile.

312
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,280
How old are you guys?

313
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,320
Seventeen.

314
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,760
Okay, when I count down to one,

315
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,960
shout "17" together.

316
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
-Okay.
-Come on.

317
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,880
Three, two, one.

318
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,520
-Seventeen!
-Seventeen!

319
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,240
Rangrang.

320
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,880
Remember to memorize English vocabulary

321
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,320
when you are in Suyang.

322
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,040
Don't forget to correct the math problems

323
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,600
that you get wrong.

324
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,040
Drinking a glass of milk before bed

325
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,040
helps you sleep.

326
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,880
Be careful

327
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,360
when you go home alone at night.

328
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,560
Smile more

329
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,200
or people will think
you're difficult to get along with.

330
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,240
No.

331
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,320
You had better not smile.

332
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,960
What if everyone finds out

333
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,440
that you have a nice smile?

334
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,920
What will I do then?

335
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,840
Su Zaizai.

336
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,280
Let's aim
for East China University together.

337
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
It's snowing.

338
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,400
That means

339
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
it's our second winter together.

340
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,200
Rangrang, happy one-year anniversary.

341
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,840
Let's make an exchange.

342
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,960
Think of it

343
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,000
as proof of what we just talked about.

344
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,560
Okay.

345
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,920
Look.

346
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,440
A snowflake left a mark.

347
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,840
So you can't break a promise

348
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,280
that you made to someone

349
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
during the first snowfall

350
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,920
or there will be serious consequences.

351
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,720
What consequences?

352
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,920
I will get angry.

353
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,600
That's very serious.

354
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,720
Zaizai!

355
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,920
NEW SEMESTER, NEW ATMOSPHERE

356
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Come.

357
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,240
<i>Rangrang, I heard from Mr. Lin</i>

358
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,880
<i>that you can't use your phone either.</i>

359
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,440
<i>So I began writing my first letter.</i>

360
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,960
<i>Now that school has started,</i>

361
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,880
<i>are you getting used to Suyang?</i>

362
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,880
<i>To be honest,</i>

363
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,560
<i>I'm not used to taking the bus</i>

364
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,920
<i>and going home alone.</i>

365
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
<i>So I started biking again.</i>

366
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,960
{\an8}-Hello, Mr. Lin.
-Su Zaizai.

367
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,920
{\an8}Hi, Susu.

368
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,560
<i>I saw Susu</i>

369
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,240
<i>when I passed by your house.</i>

370
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,280
<i>She doesn't pounce on me anymore.</i>

371
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,080
<i>I'll work harder to win her over soon.</i>

372
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,720
<i>How are you doing over there?</i>

373
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,280
<i>The new school is great.</i>

374
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,600
<i>But the curriculum moves</i>

375
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,280
<i>at a faster pace than in Jiangyi.</i>

376
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,080
<i>I've adapted to it.</i>

377
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,560
<i>I scored 122 in English</i>

378
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,200
<i>in the last monthly exam.</i>

379
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
<i>I haven't fallen behind.</i>

380
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,280
<i>You can rest assured.</i>

381
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,440
<i>That supermarket
that you went to with the flash sale</i>

382
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,960
<i>has been converted into a bookstore.</i>

383
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,720
<i>I found out when I went to buy materials.</i>

384
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,960
<i>You can check it out
when you get the chance.</i>

385
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,320
<i>Spring comes</i>

386
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,720
<i>later in Suyang than in Jiangyi.</i>

387
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,800
<i>I heard that the winter jasmine
in Jiangyi has bloomed.</i>

388
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,000
<i>You must be so happy.</i>

389
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,640
<i>Study hard.</i>

390
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,480
<i>Why do you still remember the flash sale?</i>

391
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,040
<i>That was so embarrassing.</i>

392
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,520
<i>Don't remember these things.</i>

393
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,160
<i>Let me tell you something interesting.</i>

394
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,640
<i>On April Fool's Day this year,</i>

395
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,440
<i>Guan Fang and Gu Ran acted
in</i> The Emperor's New Clothes.

396
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,720
<i>It was hilarious.</i>

397
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,200
<i>It's a pity</i>

398
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,440
<i>that you couldn't see it.</i>

399
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,000
<i>By the way,</i>

400
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,800
<i>I'm also studying hard.</i>

401
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,120
<i>Jiang Jia and I signed up</i>

402
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,440
<i>for an intensive summer math class,</i>

403
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,920
<i>so I can't visit you in Suyang.</i>

404
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,840
TO ZHANG LURANG

405
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
<i>I went south in September</i>

406
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,440
<i>to take part in a competition.</i>

407
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,720
<i>It's the furthest place
I've ever been to alone.</i>

408
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,640
<i>Everything is beautiful there.</i>

409
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,160
<i>Standing on the beach,</i>

410
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
<i>I suddenly wanted to go back to Jiangyi.</i>

411
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,120
<i>It would have been different</i>

412
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,120
<i>-if you guys were there with me.</i>
-No.

413
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,040
<i>-By the way,</i>
-He looks good in anything.

414
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
<i>-Luli got into East China University.</i>
-No need to pick out clothes.

415
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,760
<i>Mom and Dad wanted him to study finance.</i>

416
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,320
<i>He chose his favorite major, Biology.</i>

417
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,280
<i>I envy him.</i>

418
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,120
<i>I'm so happy for him.</i>

419
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,600
<i>I don't know if it's just me.</i>

420
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,040
<i>After entering Grade 12,</i>

421
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,640
<i>-I feel as if I've grown up overnight.</i>
-We're going to be late.

422
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,440
<i>I'm exhausted every day.</i>

423
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,040
<i>I wish I could be without care</i>

424
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,080
<i>and sleep for three days and three nights.</i>

425
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,520
<i>But every time I see
Grade 10 and Grade 11 students looking</i>

426
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,920
<i>admiringly,</i>

427
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,960
<i>yes, looking admiringly at us.</i>

428
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,880
<i>I feel that I can hold on a little longer.</i>

429
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,760
<i>I had a physical exam today.</i>

430
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,760
<i>I seem to have an irregular heartbeat.</i>

431
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
<i>I have a rapid heartbeat.</i>

432
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,360
<i>It keeps thumping.</i>

433
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,320
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

434
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,960
<i>I shouldn't have thought of you</i>

435
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,160
<i>during the physical exam.</i>

436
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
RANGRANG, I...

437
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,600
<i>Rangrang,</i>

438
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,080
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

439
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,720
Okay, that is all for today's class.

440
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,080
The school is doing a survey on the NCEE,

441
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,680
including your target universities
and majors.

442
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,720
Please fill it out as per your situation.

443
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,640
Wang Nan, please distribute the forms.

444
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Thank you.

445
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,960
Zaizai, where do you want to go?

446
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,960
East China University.

447
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,680
I've made a deal with Rangrang.

448
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,600
MY IDEAL UNIVERSITY AND MAJOR

449
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,440
Guan Fang,

450
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,560
what do you want to study in the future?

451
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,320
I want to study economics.

452
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,960
What is with that look?

453
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,200
I've never made a mistake
doing the accounts

454
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,840
for my grandma since I was a kid.

455
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,560
I'm obviously financially savvy.

456
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
What about you?

457
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,880
Me?

458
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,800
Medicine.

459
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,000
Both my parents are doctors.

460
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,280
I can't lose to them.

461
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,640
Jiangjiang, enough about us.

462
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,640
What about you? What do you want to study?

463
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,040
I haven't made up my mind yet.

464
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,760
It's okay. Take your time.

465
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,400
You can fill it out after the NCEE.

466
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,320
There is no rush.

467
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,120
Did we get our math exam back?

468
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,440
I put it in your desk drawer.

469
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,000
{\an8}MATH EXAM

470
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Do you two have any paper?

471
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,000
I meant tissue paper.

472
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,920
Su Zaizai, do you have any?

473
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,480
Su Zaizai.

474
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,600
-Su Zaizai.
-The paper?

475
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,560
Which problem?

476
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,720
Are you two okay?

477
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,080
I think they've gone dumb from studying.

478
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,080
Both of them are so distracted.

479
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,720
There is still some time before the NCEE.

480
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,120
Could it be that they are too stressed?

481
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,240
Maybe.

482
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,600
Let's go to your house tomorrow.

483
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,000
I miss your grandma.

484
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,720
We can also take those two to relax.

485
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,520
Sure. Leave it to me.

486
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,320
I forgot my soccer ball. I'll go get it.

487
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,320
Head back first.

488
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,520
How forgetful.

489
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,960
Has he gone dumb from studying too?

490
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,520
Am I the only normal person here?

491
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,840
I suddenly feel amazing.

492
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,600
{\an8}Why are you sighing?

493
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,520
Haven't you heard a saying?

494
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,280
"Everyone's luck is limited.

495
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,440
If you keep sighing,

496
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,080
your luck will slip away."

497
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,920
Why are you here?

498
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,760
I was picking up my ball over there.

499
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,880
I was about to get it,

500
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,320
but a gust of wind blew it away.

501
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,840
I looked up

502
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,040
and it was you sighing.

503
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,600
Tell me.

504
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,760
What is going on lately?

505
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,360
Zaizai's dream
is to be a diplomatic interpreter.

506
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,640
Guan Fang wants to study economics.

507
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,400
You all have dreams.

508
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
But I don't.

509
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,480
I don't think I've ever thought about it.

510
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,400
All I knew

511
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,680
was that after primary school

512
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,480
came junior high

513
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,400
and after that was senior high.

514
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,360
But I now realize

515
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,040
there will be no more rules after this.

516
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,600
I have to proceed on my own.

517
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,760
It's weird, right?

518
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,360
Few people have no dreams.

519
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,360
I don't even have any strengths.

520
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,120
Who says you don't?

521
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,440
Do I have any?

522
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,800
You...

523
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,840
Never mind. I won't give you a hard time.

524
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,080
Come on. It's time for evening self-study.

525
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,720
No matter what,

526
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,400
we have to pass the NCEE first.

527
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,520
Hello.

528
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,040
<i>It has been a long time.</i>

529
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,200
<i>Today is January 1st, 2015.</i>

530
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,320
<i>It's the start of a new year.</i>

531
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,760
<i>The second semester of Grade 12
is coming up.</i>

532
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,880
We only get one day off for the holiday.

533
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,920
I'm going back to school tomorrow.

534
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
There is nothing special
about the holiday.

535
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,400
All I do is study.

536
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,040
<i>But there is a silver lining.</i>

537
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
<i>Rangrang sent me a letter again.</i>

538
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,880
<i>This is the seventh letter.</i>

539
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,280
<i>The contents</i>

540
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,880
<i>are just New Year's greetings.</i>

541
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,280
He also expressed his sadness and guilt

542
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,680
for not being able to be by my side

543
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
in the coming year.

544
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,680
I understand.

545
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,080
I'm very forgiving anyway.

546
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,200
He can make it up to me later.

547
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,160
Also,

548
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,480
<i>I've only used three photo papers.</i>

549
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,000
<i>Don't blame me for being slow.</i>

550
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,400
<i>I thought about using them all at once.</i>

551
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,480
But I think this is too reckless.

552
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,000
Also, I won't make Rangrang

553
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,960
into someone who doesn't keep his word.

554
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,960
So I won't finish them

555
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,560
until I get some decent grades.

556
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,680
All right, I'll stop here.

557
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,680
I'm going to continue studying. Bye.

558
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,600
<i>The phrase "Reading a letter
is like talking face to face"</i>

559
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,840
<i>gives us enormous courage</i>

560
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,960
<i>to overcome obstacles in our way.</i>
