Good dog.

You're up.

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
Yes. Good morning, Uncle.

45
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,840
I had to get up this early.

46
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,080
At five o'clock this morning,

47
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,240
the dog ran into my room,
demanding to go outside.

48
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,560
But when we got out,

49
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,840
there were no other dogs,

50
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,840
so we hurried back.

51
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,960
Naughty dog.

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040

What's going on?

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,240
I browsed posts about our new school

57
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,880
until morning.

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,320
What's the point of doing that?

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,840
Of course,
it's to learn about our new school.

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,400

<i>Zaizai, hurry. We're going to be late.</i>

75
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,320
Stop dawdling. Just tell me.

What is your name?

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Which class are you in?

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm asking you.

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,040
Su Zaizai, Grade 10, Class 9.

80
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,360
Jiang Jia. I'm in the same class.

81
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,160
Hey, you!

82
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,280

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,680

Your name is on the book. Don't deny it.

95
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,160

One of the famous students.

-Got it.

-Zhao Wenjing.
-Here.

110
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
Girls, you're late.

111
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,200
Introduce yourselves to the class.

112
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,560
My name is Jiang Jia.

113
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,760
Jiang, as in ginger.

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,400
Jia, as in excellent.

115
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,120
Okay, sit down.

116
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,880
My name is He Yu.

117
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,240
Yu, as in jade.

118
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,400
And the other student?

119
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,840
My name is Su Zaizai.

120
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,440

121
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,000
So you're Su Zaizai.

122
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,880
Didn't you get full marks
in the English entrance exam?

123
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,600
Yes.

124
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
Okay, sit down.

125
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,160
Good for you.

126
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,400
My name is Wang Nan.

127
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
I was in No. 3 Junior High.

128
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,120
I'm Fu Yao.

129
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,400
I hate English tests.

130
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,560
Could you teach me English?

131
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,120
Okay. I'll ask you
if I have questions too.

132
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,440
No problem.

133
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,440
Sir, Zhang Lurang hasn't come yet.

134
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,880
Zhang Lurang?

135
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
He's in Class 1.

136
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,200
Why would he come here?

137
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,800
Class 1?

138
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,440
Is Zhang Lurang here?

139
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,200
There he is.

140
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,280
Are you Zhang Lurang?

141
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,960
Lurang.

142
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,720
-Wang Yang.
-Here.

143
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,480
-Han Zheng.
-Here.

144
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,360
-Li Maosheng.
-Here.

145
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,680
-Zhang Renli.
-Your books.

146
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,720
They're in order.

147
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,360
What took you so long?

148
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,680
I was late and stopped

149
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,080
by students on duty at the gate.

150
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,080
What?

151
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,200
So then, what are you going to do?

152
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,160
Are you nervous?

153
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,240
No.

154
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm just concerned about you.

155
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,360
I've heard

156
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,760
that tardy students' names get recorded.

157
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,000
-And...
-My name wasn't recorded.

158
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,320
It wasn't?

159
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,880
I'm glad to hear that.

160
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,680
Or Zhang Lurang would appear twice.

161
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,240
Don't you think

162
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,720
you're overly interested in me today?

163
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,400
Am I?

164
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,760
Not at all.

165
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
And you're not only interested,

166
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,720
but also

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,080
a little bit guilty.

168
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,360
Am I?

169
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Actually, I didn't do anything

170
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
that would hurt you too much.

171
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,760
Where are you going?

172
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,000
The broadcast studio.

173
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
The broadcast studio?

174
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,320
The more I think, the weirder I feel.

175
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,680
Why did Zhang Lurang pretend
to be in our class?

176
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Maybe he misremembered his class number.

177
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,360
I'm guessing he did that deliberately.

178
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,120
I heard that points got deducted
from their class when someone was late.

179
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,320
Su Zaizai,

180
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,920
only you haven't paid for the uniform yet.

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,480
Okay, I'll pay for it now.

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,520
Where is my wallet?

183
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,040
I picked up a wallet.

184
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,680
Is there any ID in it?

185
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,040
I haven't opened it.

186
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,520
Look inside.

187
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
You might find the owner's ID in there.

188
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,680
I told you to check.

189
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,000
You just wouldn't listen.

190
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,880
I remember

191
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,520
I put it in my pocket this morning.

192
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,680
Calm down, Zaizai.

193
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,040
How about I pay for it first? Then you...

194
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,680
You can do a lost-and-found broadcast.

195
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,840
Maybe a student picked it up.

196
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,680
Is your student ID card in your wallet?

197
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
Yes.

198
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,360
That makes things simple.

199
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,120
The ID has your photo and name on it.

200
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,240
Whoever finds it will know it is yours.

201
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,360
But...

202
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,440
But I didn't put my name

203
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,720
on my student ID card.

204
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,200
Then whose name is it?

205
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,520
It's...

206
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,960
It's...

207
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,000
<i>Attention.</i>

208
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,400
<i>This is a lost-and-found broadcast.</i>

209
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,000
<i>High school student, Liu Yifei.</i>

210
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
<i>High school student, Liu Yifei,</i>

211
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,520
<i>please come to the broadcast studio</i>

212
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,440
<i>to pick up your lost wallet.</i>

213
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,200
Is there a Liu Yifei here?

214
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,880
Then I could be Daniel Wu!

215
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,120
I'm Joey Wong. Nice to meet you.

216
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,000
Nice to meet you.

217
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,640
I'll stop looking for my wallet now.

218
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,040
Look, what a good day today!

219
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,280
I'm going out for some fresh air.

220
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,080
What's the hurry?

221
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,120
Wait.

222
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,880
Su Zaizai,

223
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,440
you're that Liu Yifei, aren't you?

224
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,200
THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL, LIU YIFEI

225
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,960
Yes, it's me.

226
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,440
High school student, Liu Yifei?

227
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,360
Check if anything is missing.

228
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,120
"Zhang Lurang. Gu Ran."

229
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
FINDERS

230
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,320
Were they the ones who found this wallet?

231
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,800
Two boys brought it here.

232
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,840
They just left.

233
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,840
Zhang Lurang?

234
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,640
Isn't he the guy we met this morning?

235
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,320
We can still catch up. Hurry.

236
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Faster, Zaizai.

237
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
There they are.

238
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,480
Zaizai, hurry up.

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
Over here!

240
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,160
Zhang Lurang! Gu Ran!

241
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
Hey!

242
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,960
Hey!

243
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,960
What? I didn't get a good look.

244
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,200
Gu Ran?

245
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,600
It's him. Is his name Gu Ran?

246
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,320
Do you know him?

247
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,360
I've seen him at the corner store.

248
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,960
What?

249
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Regarding military training,

250
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,920
that is all I have to say.

251
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,360
Now, I'll talk about disciplines.

252
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,000
Today is the first day of school.

253
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,560
But some students were still late.

254
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,400
The Office of Academic Affairs told me

255
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,200
that students on the tardy list

256
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,760
will have to stand guard

257
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,240
at the military training base.

258
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,320
Nine students were late this morning.

259
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,360
Two are from our class, the honors class.

260
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,040
Someone was not only late,

261
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,960
but also misremembered his class.

262
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,760
What is it?

263
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,960
Do you wish to be in Class 9?

264
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,320
Let me read their names.

265
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,680
From our class,

266
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,360
Zhang Lurang

267
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,920
and Gu Ran.

268
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,680
Su Zaizai and Jiang Jia.

269
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,960
Behave when you're punished tomorrow.

270
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,200
Try to be the most energetic students.

271
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,800
<i>Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.,</i>

272
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,160
assemble at the school gate.

273
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,160
Remember.

274
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,160
Do not be late.

275
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,280
Since when did you become Gu Ran?

276
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,640
When you changed your name

277
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,640
to Zhang Lurang.

278
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,200
Students have military training together.

279
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,680
I guess I can meet Gu Ran again.

280
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,600
-It's so hot.
-I'm melting.

281
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,880
Why isn't the teacher here yet?

282
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,080
It's taking so long.

283
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,320
Why can't we get on the bus yet?

284
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,040
-It's too hot.
-Where is our teacher?

285
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,840
It's too hot.

286
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,720
Students, here's the thing.

287
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
There are too many of us.

288
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,600
One bus can't hold all of us.

289
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,960
I just checked Class 1's bus.

290
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,200
There are some vacant seats.

291
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,640
Who would like to go?

292
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,600
How could this happen?

293
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,120
I don't want to go to Class 1.

294
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,240
Who would want to join another class?

295
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,120
Class 1?

296
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,440
Class 1.

297
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Su Zaizai.

298
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,400
Gu Ran?

299
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,200
Sit beside me.

300
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,760
I...

301
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,120
May I call you Zaizai?

302
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,680
Zaizai.

303
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,440
Zaizai.

304
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,360
Sir, I'll go to Class 1.

305
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,720
Okay.

306
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
Su...

307
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,160
Su Zaizai, right?

308
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,600
Very good.

309
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,640
Su Zaizai set a good example.

310
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,880
Who else wants to go?

311
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,840
-Sir, we can also go.
-We can go.

312
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,880
Go.

313
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,920
Okay. Time is running out.

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,200
You guys can get on their bus.

315
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,040
When you get off, come back to me.

316
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,360
Su Zaizai, are you out of your mind?

317
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,200
Think about it.

318
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,160
Gu Ran found my wallet.

319
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,840
I haven't had a chance to thank him.

320
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,960
I get it. Come on.

321
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,480
Why are Class 9's students
coming to our bus?

322
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,680
Some buses are full,

323
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,600
but ours isn't.

324
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Lurang, cover me. Hurry.

325
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,440
{\an8}Sorry.

326
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,480
{\an8}They're so noisy.

327
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,840
{\an8}How can I focus on my vocabulary?

328
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,280
What's wrong?

329
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,680
Class 9's students are coming.

330
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,200
Yes. So?

331
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,360
Aren't you also from Class 9?

332
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,080
Are you afraid of seeing them?

333
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,720
Who said that?

334
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,600
Hey.

335
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
There is space here. Put your bags here.

336
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,840
Okay, thank you.

337
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,120
CHIBI THREE KINGDOMS

338
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,680
Thank you.

339
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
-Weird.
-Why are they here?

340
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,680
Why didn't I see Gu Ran and Zhang Lurang?

341
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,400
They stand out. I should have seen them.

342
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,280
I did.

343
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,480
Gu Ran just helped me put away my bag.

344
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,599
Did he?

345
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,720
Where is he?

346
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,000
There.

347
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,079
That one.

348
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,160
I can't see them.

349
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,599
I only see the back of their heads.

350
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,400
{\an8}JIAOYUN GROUP

351
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,120
You brought so many snacks.

352
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,760
Is this a vacation?

353
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,360
Do high school students

354
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,320
not know anything about military training?

355
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,360
From this day on,

356
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,360
Class 1, Class 5, and Class 9

357
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,400
will be in my charge

358
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,560
this week.

359
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,440
You can call me Mr. Fang.

360
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,840
Who allowed you to move?

361
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,560
Did you see Gu Ran diagonally behind us?

362
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,680
Destiny set us up in adjacent teams.

363
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,760
These difficulties are no big deal.

364
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,320
Zhang Lurang is there too.

365
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,000
Lurang.

366
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,960
Did you see that?

367
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,000
They peeked at me.

368
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,600
Who talked?

369
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,840
Learn to be independent,

370
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,320
confident,

371
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,000
and self-reliant.

372
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,760
Do you understand?

373
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,320
-Yes.
-Yes.

374
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,640
I can't hear you! Do you understand?

375
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,080
-Yes!
-Yes!

376
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,600
Everyone, be at ease.

377
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm so tired.

378
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,640
Hand in

379
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,920
all of your snacks and electronics.

380
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,520
You have three minutes.

381
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,400
Place all your prohibited items

382
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,200
into the bins at the front.

383
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,440
We weren't told in advance
that electronics are forbidden.

384
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,720
{\an8}Come on, Zaizai. Hide some.

385
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,680
{\an8}Be quick.

386
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,760
You're good at hiding things.

387
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,840
I sewed my PSP into my pants.

388
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,440
Clever, aren't I?

389
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
Hurry up.

390
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,520
I think Mr. Fang is right.

391
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,800
Be disciplined and independent.

392
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,560
What?

393
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,640
You. What are you hiding?

394
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,600
Hello, Mr. Fang.

395
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,080
Take them out.

396
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,000
Mr. Fang, there is no more.

397
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
What is in your shirt?

398
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,680
It's my fat.

399
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,440
You're playing dumb, aren't you?

400
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,880
Put your hands up and jump three times.

401
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Start.

402
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,680
Jump harder. Go on!

403
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,720
It would've become my fat sooner or later.

404
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,560
Do 50 frog jumps. Get ready.

405
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,560
Fall out!

406
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,640
She's quite funny.

407
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,400
Funny?

408
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,240
No, sir.

409
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,000
Then what were you laughing at?

410
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,840
Mr. Fang,

411
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
I had a face twitch.

412
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,440
You're playing dumb, aren't you?

413
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,160
Do 50 frog jumps with her. Get ready.

414
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,760
But I...

415
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,360
If you dawdle, do another 20.

416
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,720
Yes, sir!

417
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,240
You're from Class 1.

418
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,360
But you said you were from Class 9.

419
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,680
You did that on purpose, right?

420
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,160
I never said I was from Class 9.

421
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,920
I won't argue with you.

422
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,200
Why are you jumping so hard?

423
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,120
We jump at the same pace.

424
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,760
As long as we jump together,

425
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,760
we can fudge the numbers.

426
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,680
Really?

427
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,680
Of course.

428
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,960
Don't worry. I'll wait for you.

429
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,960
Are you still chatting?

430
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,320
Do you plan to jump until nightfall?

431
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,920
The last one to finish

432
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
will clean the playground tomorrow.

433
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,240
Why is Mr. Fang so...

434
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,640
Seriously?

435
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,680
Liar.

436
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,160
Despicable.

437
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,040
I will never trust you again.

438
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,520
He sure is competitive.

439
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,360
You'll get used to that.

440
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,840
The rest of you, take your luggage

441
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,320
to your dorms and do some cleaning.

442
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,880
Also, each dorm shall send some students

443
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,200
to fetch daily necessities

444
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,440
behind the dorms.

445
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,800
Jiangjiang,

446
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,360
are you okay?

447
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,640
Yes. I'm still alive.

448
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,400
I just have a leg cramp.

449
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,960
The punishment doesn't matter.

450
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,000
But Zhang Lurang is way too terrible.

451
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,760
I agree with you.

452
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
The line is quite long.

453
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
How about I go
to the infirmary for medicine

454
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
for your legs and heat stroke?

455
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,440
Okay, I'll get your daily necessities.

456
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,360
Okay.

457
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,120
Who is this Zhang Lurang you mentioned?

458
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,560
The one who did the frog jump with me.

459
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,200
But I think he's a good guy.

460
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,560
Him? He isn't charming at all.

461
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,680
By any chance,

462
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,400
have you met Gu Ran?

463
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,880
Gu Ran? I've heard about him.

464
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,120
Two freshmen are very famous.

465
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,440
One is Gu Ran.

466
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,640
The other is Zhang Lurang.

467
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,640
Gu Ran is really excellent.

468
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,680
{\an8}He has great grades.

469
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,280
{\an8}He's also very polite.

470
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,200
Most importantly, he's a Good Samaritan.

471
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,600
{\an8}He's a handsome role model.

472
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,680
{\an8}Zhang Lurang can't compare to Gu Ran.

473
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,720
Not at all.

474
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,880
Jiang Jia and Su Zaizai.

475
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,960
Way to go.

476
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,080
I've actually been keeping a low profile.

477
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,160
I'll show him to you when I can.

478
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,320
You won't be disappointed.

479
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,160
You make me want to see him now.

480
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,680
Tell me your class and name.

481
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,480
Class 1.

482
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,160
Gu Ran.

483
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,240
Is he Gu Ran?

484
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,240
He's so cool.

485
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,600
He's unbelievably handsome.

486
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,880
Class 1.

487
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Look.

488
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,160
Class 1, Guan Fang.

489
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,120
Is anyone here?

490
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,440
Is anyone here?

491
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,880
Doctor?

492
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,080
Is no one here?

493
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,560
I heard our dorm has no air-conditioning.

494
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,520
I'll enjoy it here for a bit.

495
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,360
Just a second.

496
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,120
It feels so good.

497
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,600
My air-conditioning.

498
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,680
Doctor,

499
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,640
what took you so long?

500
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,040
I think

501
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,080
I have a heat stroke.

502
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,560
So I laid down in bed for some rest.

503
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,800
Doctor?

504
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,360
Then you can't use the AC.
I'll turn it off.

505
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
Hey, wait!

506
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
You don't need to.

507
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,640
I have a special physique.

508
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,320
When I have a heat stroke,

509
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,560
I feel dizzy,

510
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
weak all over,

511
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,720
and a little bit nauseous.

512
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,120
Nothing can make me feel better

513
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,360
except for air-conditioning.

514
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,080
-Doctor.
-Do you need medicine?

515
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,720
-Yes.
-Have you registered?

516
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,640
The register book is on the desk.

517
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,560
Before you leave,

518
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,720
write down your class

519
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,880
and the medicine you took.

520
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,040
Register?

521
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,320
Doctor,

522
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,440
I haven't taken anything.

523
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,440
I just came and got some rest.

524
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,680
Is there another student here?

525
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,640
What's wrong?

526
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,800
Her?

527
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,360
She's seriously ill.

528
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,120
Tell me. What's wrong with you?

529
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,760
<i>Is this how I record?</i>

530
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,080
<i>Okay, done.</i>

531
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,360
<i>Hello, I'm Zaizai.</i>

532
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,320
<i>This is how I'm going</i>

533
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,040
<i>to record my daily life.</i>

534
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,080
<i>Today is September 2nd, 2012, Sunday.</i>

535
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,640
<i>I'm a high school student
from this day on.</i>

536
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,400
<i>Thinking of tomorrow's military training</i>

537
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,600
<i>gives me a headache.</i>

538
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,840
<i>But I've packed a lot of snacks.</i>

539
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
<i>This week should go by smoothly.</i>

540
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,240
<i>One more thing.</i>

541
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,400
<i>Today, I have to thank this</i>

542
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,400
<i>for letting me see him again.</i>

543
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,360
<i>I even learned his name.</i>

544
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,360
<i>Gu Ran.</i>

545
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,240
<i>Thanks to him, I got my wallet back.</i>

546
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,000
<i>I suddenly feel excited</i>

547
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,640
<i>for every day to come.</i>

548
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
<i>Su Zaizai, why did you lock the door?</i>

549
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,760
<i>Don't you know</i>

550
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,280
you have military training tomorrow?

551
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,680
I know, Mom. I'll go to bed soon.

552
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,200
Anyway, I...

553
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,200
<i>Su Zaizai!</i>

554
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,520
<i>Okay, let's call it a day. Good night.</i>

555
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,760
<i>Hey, do you feel honored?</i>

556
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,400
<i>I seem to have done only two things today</i>

557
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,880
<i>and they both have to do with you.</i>
