00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
My...

7
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
My son left his test paper here

8
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,720
and asked me to pick it up.

9
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,200
I see.

10
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,800
Is your son in Grade 12 too?

11
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,120
Yes, Grade 12.

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,560
Well, Grade 12 students
have tight schedules,

13
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,200
so he asked me to get it for him.

14
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm sure.

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,680
He's definitely not a student's parent.

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,240
He said his son is in Grade 12,

17
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,960
but he headed for the Grade 11 building.

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,440
And he looked sneaky and guilty.

19
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,120
A lot of things have gone missing lately.

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,320
It must be his doing.

21
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,640
The lock on the west gate is broken.

22
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,120
It hasn't been fixed yet.

23
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,880
And he came from that direction.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,880
There is a good chance
he will leave from there.

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,360
Sirs, please go catch him.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,920
Go check it out.

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,920
I'll leave first.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
Let me know if anything happens, sir.

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,840
Gu Ran?

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,280
You have no idea

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,880
how good my sixth sense is.

32
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,040
I could tell he was not a good man,

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,760
so I was extra cautious.

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,560
You're not an idiot.

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,160
You didn't expose him to his face.

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,320
Of course.

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,360
I've reached my house. Bye.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,160
Jiang Jia.

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,400
You actually have a lot of strengths.

40
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,480
Like what?

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,240
You're brave

42
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,720
and always righteous.

43
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,480
You're calm and not reckless.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
It took you two nights

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,040
to make that up, didn't it?

46
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,080
No.

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,120
When we talk about strengths,

48
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,560
people always immediately think

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,360
of extraordinary intelligence

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,920
and innate talent.

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,480
We believe

52
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,760
everyone possesses courage and composure.

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,240
That's actually not true.

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,400
Does everyone stand up

55
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,080
when they see injustice?

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,880
No.

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Does everyone empathize with the weak?

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,640
Also no.

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,800
Your uncommon bravery and righteousness

60
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,320
are really hard to come by.

61
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,000
Aren't they strengths?

62
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,680
You're such a sweet talker.

63
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,960
Tell me more next time.

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,880
You enjoy the praise, don't you?

<i>Are you aiming for East China University?</i>

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,320
Yes.

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,640
That's the same as Lurang.

71
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,440
He told me that he wants to go there too.

72
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,400
Let me look at your report card.

73
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,000
If you want to go there,

74
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,920
you need to get at least 110 in math

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,280
even if you can score
consistently above 135 in English.

76
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,800
You still need to work harder in math.

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,680
Feel free to ask me
if you have trouble with math.

78
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,240
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lin.

79
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,240
By the way,

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,640
English is your strong suit.

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,680
Taking the autonomous admission exam

82
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,160
will give you an advantage.

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Although East China University
is not included,

84
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,120
there are still some good schools.

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,480

Thank you.

94

You're welcome.

95
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,200
Which school are you from?

96
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,840
Jiangyi's First High School.
What about you?

97
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,520
I'm from Suyang No. 1 High School.

98
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,280
Suyang No. 1 High School?

99
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,280
Then do you know Zhang Lurang

100
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
in Grade 12?

101
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,880
Zhang Lurang?

102
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,840
I get it.

103
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,400
Zhang Lurang was studying in Jiangyi
before he transferred.

104
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
It must be your school.

105
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
He sure has a lot of influence.

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,640
Do you know anything else about him?

107
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,600
Not really.

108
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,400
He usually keeps a low profile.

109
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,840
Are you trying

110
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,760
to find out his phone number?

111
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,000
I can't help you with that.

112
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,720
He doesn't even accept gifts from girls.

113
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,120
He seems completely focused on studying.

114
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,560
You should give up on him.

115
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,160
You are

116
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,120
really obsessed with him, aren't you?

117
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,040
This photo editing looks so real.

118
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,480
My deskmate did the same too.

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,880
But his eyes turned out crooked.

120
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,720
Next, Su Zaizai.

121
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,480
Is Su Zaizai here?

122
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,520
I'm coming.

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,520
Good luck.

AUTONOMOUS ADMISSION EXAM

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,960
I was a bit nervous at first.

126
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,400
But I felt better after a while.

127
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,560
I answered all of the teachers' questions.

128
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,760
<i>I'm glad to hear that.</i>

129
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,760
<i>Zaizai, what time is your bus?</i>

130
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,040
<i>Gu Ran, Guan Fang, and I
are eating near the bus station.</i>

131
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
<i>We can pick you up.</i>

132
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,760
There are still more than two hours

133
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,200
before the bus leaves from Suyang.

134
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,720
That gives me time

135
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,920
to visit Rangrang's school while I'm here.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,680
<i>But he can't use his phone.</i>

137
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,040
<i>He won't know you're there.</i>

138
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,680
<i>Gu Ran, don't eavesdrop.</i>

139
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,680
<i>It's not eavesdropping
if you're on speaker.</i>

140
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,880
It doesn't matter if he doesn't know.

141
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,240
I just want to take a look.

142
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,480
I have to go now. Bye.

Sir.

148
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,280
Can you help me take a picture?

149
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,840
You're not from this school, are you?

150
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,120
No, I'm not.

151
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,520
But my friend studies here.

152
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,480
Then I'll make sure I take a nice photo.

153
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,800
You can send it to him later.

154
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,320
Thank you.

155
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,240
Don't stand there.

156
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,240
Pictures come out better
with the view over there.

157
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,400
It's okay.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
I'll stand here.

162
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,760
Rangrang?

163
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,640
It's not the weekend. Why are you here?

164
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,480
Gu Ran called Luli and said

165
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,720
you came to our school.

166
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,920
I happened to be nearby.

167
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,320
So I rushed over
to see if you were still here.

168
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,160
Gu Ran sure sends news fast.

169
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,640
It has been a while. I...

170
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,720
We miss you.

171
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,360
It has been a while.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,680
You mentioned the school in your letters.

173
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,240
Now that I've come to see it,

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,880
it feels as if I've been here before.

175
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,000
It's mystifying.

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,120
Do you want to look inside?

177
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,360
Rangrang, is that the tree

178
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,920
that you said is even older than us?

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,960
Actually, there is
nothing special about it.

180
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,440
It's just that when I just arrived,

181
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,720
I wanted to tell you about everything.

182
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,240
Then you should write more.

183
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,400
I don't mind reading it.

184
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,240
Gu Ran said you're here

185
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,120
for an autonomous admission interview.

186
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,160
Yes.

187
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,440
My current grades are not good enough

188
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,880
to get into East China University.

189
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,920
I think I should play it safe.

190
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,640
That's good too.

191
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,160
Rangrang, I didn't expect you

192
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,360
to be so popular in Suyang too.

193
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,960
They must be wondering who I am

194
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,520
and why I am with you.

195
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,360
Rangrang,

196
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,120
I took the autonomous admission interview

197
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,160
not because I wanted
to give up on East China University.

198
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,160
I just don't want
to gamble everything on the NCEE

199
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,080
and make everyone worry about me.

200
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,840
After I get back to Jiangyi,

201
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,800
I'll study even harder.

202
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,520
But whether we can get

203
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,000
into the same university or not,

204
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,800
you should pursue your own goals.

205
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,760
Let's not give up our dreams

206
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,280
for other people.

207
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,840
I don't like that.

208
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,280
Becoming better together

209
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,680
is the coolest thing.

210
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,560
All right.

211
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
You too.

212
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,520
No matter what the result is,

213
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,320
it's okay if we give it our best.

214
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,400
100 DAYS TO THE NCEE!

215
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,040
Before we begin,

216
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
I have two pieces of good news to share.

217
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,400
Our class's Xu Mingliang

218
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,760
has passed and received
a guaranteed admission offer

219
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,240
from the University of South China.

220
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,600
Also, Wang Nan,

221
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,120
Su Zaizai, and Chen Min

222
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,080
have passed the autonomous admission exam.

223
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,600
You can say your hard work has paid off.

224
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,920
Congratulations.

225
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,960
Okay, let's start our lesson.

226
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,120
Don't you think

227
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
it's too early to give up now?

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,160
As long as you work hard,

229
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,480
you can always find the answers

230
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,920
to the textbooks' problems.

231
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,720
But you will encounter
many difficult problems

232
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,160
in your life in the future.

233
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,680
Those have no standard answers.

234
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,280
Of course, you may not understand

235
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,680
what I'm saying now.

236
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,560
But years later,

237
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,200
you will definitely miss this hot summer.

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
So students,

239
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,880
let's cheer up

240
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,360
and don't do anything you will regret.

241
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,360
It's never too late

242
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,920
to start working hard.

243
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,760
Now is the best moment.

244
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,640
<i>Rangrang, Mr. Lin is indeed your uncle.</i>

245
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,840
<i>His words</i>

246
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,560
<i>have ignited passion in all of us.</i>

247
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,360
<i>I've never felt so motivated before.</i>

248
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,280
<i>Rangrang, this will be my last letter.</i>

249
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,840
<i>As the NCEE approaches,</i>

250
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,880
<i>time suddenly feels like sand</i>

251
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,800
<i>slipping through my fingers,</i>

252
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,560
<i>gone in the blink of an eye.</i>

253
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,960
<i>I've even been eating</i>

254
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,000
<i>a lot faster.</i>

255
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,280
GUAN'S DESSERT SHOP

256
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,080
Stop studying. Quick.

257
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,120
Eat your food.

258
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,400
Eat some wontons.

259
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,400
<i>I'm really tired.</i>

260
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,680
<i>But when I think</i>

261
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,960
<i>that you're also working hard
someplace else,</i>

262
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,560
<i>I feel like I can keep persevering.</i>

263
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,240
<i>I have good news.</i>

264
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,680
<i>My math scores</i>

265
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,960
<i>have been consistently above 100.</i>

266
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,760
<i>Rangrang, I believe in miracles again.</i>

267
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,280
TO ZHANG LURANG

268
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,000
<i>See? You clearly can do it.</i>

269
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,800
Luli.

270
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,200
Lurang.

271
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,120
<i>Sometimes, taking one more step forward</i>

272
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
<i>doesn't seem to be that difficult.</i>

273
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,120
<i>The countdown in our class</i>

274
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,480
<i>is updated every day.</i>

275
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,960
<i>Throwing coins into the wishing fountain</i>

276
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,440
<i>has become a popular trend in the school.</i>

277
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,000
<i>I don't believe in these things.</i>

278
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,120
<i>But I think that if you were here,</i>

279
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,880
<i>you would be enthusiastic about it.</i>

280
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,040
<i>So I decided to throw a coin as well.</i>

281
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,160
<i>Many people attribute this experience</i>

282
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,120
<i>to life-changing significance.</i>

283
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,080
<i>But I just hope...</i>

284
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,040
FROM ZHANG LURANG TO SU ZAIZAI

285
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
<i>...you won't let your efforts go to waste.</i>

287
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,920

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,280
<i>Candidates, please cooperate</i>

289
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,920
<i>and go through identity verification</i>

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,360

2015 GRADUATION CEREMONY

303
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,160
FOR THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL
AFFILIATED TO JIANGYI UNIVERSITY

304
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,160
-Let's take a picture together.
-Okay.

305
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,120
Let's take another one. Hey!

306
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
Su Zaizai, let's take a picture.

307
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,120
-Here.
-Sure.

308
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,320
I wasn't ready.

309
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,400
Hey.

310
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,840
I've taken pictures with them.

311
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,760
Let's take one.

312
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,160
You did? Okay.

313
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,840
Okay, all done.

314
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,800
Wait a minute.

315
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,040
My eyes were closed.

316
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,040
Let's take one more.

317
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,080
Fine.

318
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,200
There you go.

319
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,960
It's blurry. Let's take another one.

320
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,000
For a guy,

321
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,480
why are you so fussy about a picture?

322
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,400
No more.

323
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,960
{\an8}Guan Fang, let's take a picture.

324
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
-No!
-Come on. Let's take another one.

325
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,000
You're so annoying!

326
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,079
Quick. Just one more.

327
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,359
-No.
-What are you doing?

328
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,400
Stop it.

329
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,440
-Go away.
-It looks nice.

330
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,000
Let's take another one.

331
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,160
-Please.
-Let's do it.

332
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,560
Okay.

333
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,040
How about the three of us together?

334
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,280
Hello, Rangrang.

335
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,040
-Let's take one more!
-Guess where we are now.

336
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,480
<i>-At school?</i>
-You deserved that.

337
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,000
It's the graduation ceremony.

338
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,960
All the graduates are here.

339
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,040
It's strange though.

340
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,320
Today, I'm suddenly reluctant

341
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,080
to leave the school
that I used to be sick of.

342
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,160
And the stern dean

343
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,920
has been smiling all day today.

344
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,920
Rangrang,

345
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,000
happy graduation.

346
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,240
Su Zaizai.

347
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,040
Happy graduation.

348
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,920
-Lurang!
-Lurang!

349
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,560
It has been so long! This is so sudden.

350
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,280
I wanted to come back

351
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,600
for your graduation ceremony.

352
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,240
You're a great friend.

353
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
You've gotten thinner.

354
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,760
But you're still just as handsome.

355
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,920
Zhang Lurang, perfect timing.

356
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,320
Let me take a group photo for you.

357
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,240
Good idea. Come on.

358
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,280
Come.

359
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,520
Stand closer together.

360
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,280
I'll start counting.

361
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,400
Three.

362
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,640
Two.

363
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
One.

364
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,000
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

365
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,040
I'm not bragging here.

366
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,360
Grandma's new pineapple shaved ice
is really amazing.

367
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,480
You guys have to try it.

368
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,160
Grandma, Gu Ran and the others are here.

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,280
Grandma?

371
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,560
Grandma.

372
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,160
Did she go out?

373
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,720
But the shop isn't locked up.

374
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,800
Guan Fang!

375
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,520
Hurry to the hospital.

376
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,200
Your grandma fell and was unconscious.

377
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,840
The ambulance left just a while ago.

378
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,720
Sir, which hospital?

379
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,000
-The People's Hospital.
-Thank you!

380
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,440
GUAN'S DESSERT SHOP

381
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,480
Excuse me.

382
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
How is the elderly person
who was just brought in?

383
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,520
-I'm her family.
-They're still conducting tests.

384
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,160
How is she now?

385
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,400
We're currently trying
to contact Chen Lan's family.

386
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
Okay.

387
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,600
I'm Chen Lan's family.

388
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,720
Ranran, what are you doing here?

389
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,720
Mom,

390
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,000
he's my friend.

391
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,560
Where are your parents?

392
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,240
It's just me. She's my grandma.

393
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,640
Ms. Chen, how is his grandma doing?

394
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,840
The preliminary diagnosis
is a ruptured spleen

395
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,160
and hemorrhagic shock.

396
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,440
She's undergoing some tests.

397
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,880
She needs immediate surgery.

398
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,560
I'll explain the procedure
and risks of the surgery to you first.

399
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,040
Then you can sign the consent form.

400
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,240
Come with me.

401
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,360
We'll wait here.

402
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,480
And then complications may arise,

403
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,000
{\an8}such as bleeding,

404
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,760
gallbladder dysfunction,
bile duct stricture,

405
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,440
and hepatic dysfunction.

406
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,960
This is a common surgery, right?

407
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,560
Yes.

408
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,920
Are there risks during the surgery?

409
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
All surgeries have risks

410
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,400
and various unexpected situations
may occur.

411
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
But we'll do our best.

412
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,920
Thank you.

413
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,600
What else can I do?

414
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,920
You're already doing a great job
staying calm at your age.

415
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,160
After you sign this,

416
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
you can wait outside the operating room.

417
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,640
SIGNATURE OF NEXT OF KIN

418
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,680
{\an8}I'll sign it right away.

419
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,920
{\an8}SIGNATURE OF NEXT OF KIN: GUAN FANG

420
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,560
Mom.

421
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,360
The surgery has been quite successful.

422
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,560
Your grandma will come out soon.

423
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,040
But further observation is still needed.

424
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,400
Thank you, doctor.

425
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Everything is okay now.

426
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,240
Thank you.

427
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,920
If you're sleepy, take a nap.

428
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,120
It's okay.

429
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,160
I'm not sleepy.

430
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,720
<i>She woke up at noon.</i>

431
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,440
But she's still feeling weary.

432
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,880
She dozed off quickly.

433
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,880
I'm glad she's awake.

434
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,480
We won't be going inside then.

435
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,200
We should let her get more rest.

436
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,000
Remember to pay the fees
and collect the medication.

437
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,720
Okay, thank you.

438
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,800
You look like you haven't slept all night.

439
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,400
You should get some sleep.

440
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,880
I know my way around.

441
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,600
We can handle the little things for you.

442
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
Yes. You probably haven't eaten either.

443
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,840
Rangrang and I will buy you some food.

444
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Thank you.

445
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,200
Let's go.

446
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,200
Go.

447
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,440
It has only been just a few days.

448
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,920
But your wrinkles have increased a lot.

449
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,360
Why don't we buy

450
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,480
those toners or creams
mentioned on television

451
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,840
that disappear wrinkles immediately

452
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,360
after use?

453
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,160
Let's see if they work.

454
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,200
It would be great if they did work.

455
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,640
Grandma?

456
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,640
You're awake.

457
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,360
I thought

458
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,600
I heard Gu Ran and the others talking.

459
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,440
Yes, they will be here later.

460
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,520
Is the graduation ceremony over?

461
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,000
Mr. Chen said they waited

462
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,680
outside the school entrance

463
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,560
on their children's graduation day.

464
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,360
I didn't even know.

465
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,960
And I couldn't go to pick you up.

466
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,520
Your high school graduation ceremony

467
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,160
only happens once.

468
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,640
I had planned to close the shop early

469
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,000
to attend it.

470
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,440
But in the end,

471
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,040
I couldn't make it.

472
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,920
Instead, you ended up coming

473
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,160
to the hospital

474
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,720
and having to bustle around.

475
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,880
Time really flies.

476
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,280
I always felt

477
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,440
like you were shorter than me yesterday.

478
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
But in the blink of an eye,

479
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,800
you've grown so much.

480
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,920
You've become an adult.

481
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,800
Grandma,

482
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,360
come send me off

483
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,840
when the university semester starts.

484
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,120
And when I find a job,

485
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,080
you can pick me up and drop me off.

486
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,640
By then,

487
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,800
I probably won't be able to walk anymore.

488
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,080
Then

489
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,200
I'll be the one who picks you up.

490
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,080
If that doesn't work,

491
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
I'll carry you on my back.

492
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,200
That would be so tiring.

493
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,760
But when I was little,

494
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,000
didn't you always carry me like that too?

495
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,280
Good.

496
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,800
Good boy.

497
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,400
Good.

498
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,480
{\an8}Can she be discharged now?

499
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,000
{\an8}I'll do the discharge paperwork in a bit.

500
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,320
That's great.

501
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,280
Have you seen how well Guan Fang
has been taking care of her?

502
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,360
My mom used to compare me only to Lurang.

503
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,400
Now, great.

504
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,600
She will use Guan Fang too.

505
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,760
I always thought

506
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,120
I would become an adult

507
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,240
once I turned 18.

508
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,320
But recently, I've suddenly realized

509
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,000
that being an adult

510
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,800
means taking on responsibility.

511
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,120
My grandma has had a hard life.

512
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,560
It's my turn to protect her from now on.

513
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,200
I'm really glad to have you guys here.

514
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,840
That means adults also need friends.

515
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,520
Yes, they do.

516
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,000
Because only with friends around

517
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,440
can adults
temporarily not act like adults.

518
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,800
The evening after the rain
is so beautiful.

519
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,120
The weather tomorrow will be nice.

520
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,880
Yes, I'm sure it will be.

521
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
Rangrang, I'm home.

522
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,640
You should go back and rest early.

523
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,440
Su Zaizai.

524
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,040
The weather

525
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,080
will be nice tomorrow.

526
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,240
You mentioned it earlier.

527
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,120
So

528
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,720
will you be free?

529
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,280
<i>I'm really going to graduate.</i>

530
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,400
<i>I just realized
how reluctant I am to leave.</i>

531
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,040
<i>Actually, there is one thing</i>

532
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,320
<i>in high school</i>

533
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,800
<i>that I have always regretted.</i>

534
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,480
<i>That is,</i>

535
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
<i>I never had the chance</i>

536
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,160
<i>to experience being in the same class
as Rangrang.</i>

537
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,320
<i>It's such a pity.</i>

538
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,880
<i>I wanted to sit next to him</i>

539
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,280
<i>and spend 12 hours with him every day</i>

540
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,440
<i>from morning to evening.</i>

541
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,760
<i>Then I would pretend
to borrow a pen from him.</i>

542
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,440
<i>And I would look over...</i>

543
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,880
<i>Rangrang, what are you doing here?</i>

544
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,200
<i>What are you recording?</i>

545
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,240
<i>I'm recording precious memories</i>

546
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,560
<i>of our high school graduation.</i>

547
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,280
<i>Then did you record it?</i>

548
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,040
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

549
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,720
<i>Thank you, Rangrang.</i>

550
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
<i>At this moment,</i>

551
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,600
<i>we are deskmates.</i>

552
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,760
<i>How nice!</i>
