00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,240
After you get your exam papers back,

8
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,680
check your mistakes.

9
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,560
Thank goodness I passed!

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,080
Do you all have your papers?

11
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,440
Let me start
with a summary of your performance.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,160
Excuse me, Ms. Zhang.

13
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,080
What is the matter?

14
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,880
I didn't get my exam paper.

15
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,840
What is your name?

16
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,360
Su Zaizai.

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,560
Right.

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Su Zaizai,

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,560
in the assessment exam taken
by two classes,

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
you got the highest score, 138.

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,640
So I circulated your paper

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,200
among the students in Class 1.

23
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,320
You may take it back after class.

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,080
Share your classmate's exam for now.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,560
Class 1?

26
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,560
Okay.

HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH ASSESSMENT

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,880
I'm surprised.

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
Su Zaizai is so good at English.

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,480
Why doesn't she usually speak English?

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, if you put it that way,

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,520
you should speak classical Chinese

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
if you do well in Chinese.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,640
Good point!

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,880
Is it Su Zaizai's paper?

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,840
Yes.

{\an8}ZHANG LURANG,
HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH ASSESSMENT

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,640
Don't get me wrong.

39
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm not following you.

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,640
I put a tracker

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,120
on my English exam paper.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
It brought me here.

43
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,640
All right.

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,400
I went to your class to get my paper.

45
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,160
Gu Ran told me that it was with you

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,760
and that you were in the reading room,

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,360
so I came here.

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,440
Sorry.

49
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,640
I mistakenly took it with me.

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,080
It's no big deal.

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,680
You didn't mean to. I get it.

52
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,040
Are you still doing
the fill-in-the-blanks?

53
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,839
Did you fall asleep too?

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,440
It's time for class. Let's go back.

55
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
Rangrang,

56
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,480
you're too slow at fill-in-the-blanks.

57
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,600
You spent almost half an hour.

58
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,080
It's a waste of time.

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
When I don't understand something,

60
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,440
I don't want to move on.

61
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,800
Did you really understand it?

62
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,480
But you only answered
three problems correctly.

63
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,280
Do you really understand it?

64
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,640
Do you really understand
how to calculate acceleration?

65
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,960
That's because
I don't pay attention to physics.

66
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,760
It's okay that you're not good at English.

67
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,880
Listen, my scores
in physics and chemistry combined

68
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,200
don't even add up to 100.

69
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,440
I still don't have

70
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,440
the periodic table of elements memorized.

71
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
And I really don't know
the unit of acceleration.

72
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,520
What are you trying to say?

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,040
Do you still not understand?

74
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,840
I was emphasizing your excellence.

75
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,720
I almost made myself sound super stupid

76
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,920
and you still don't get it.

77
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,160
Zhang Lurang.

78
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,800
Don't blindly do exercises.

79
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,680
Reciting vocabulary is more useful.

80
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,840
Hey, Rangrang,

81
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,280
do you know your mom is here?

82
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,040
Who called her here?

83
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,360
Don't you know?

84
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,600
I just saw them talking in the office.

85
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,840
I thought I was wrong.

86
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,560
Yes, I'm not usually here.

87
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,760
I'm on a business trip

88
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,880
and wanted to stop by.

89
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,760
How is Zhang Lurang doing recently?

90
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,320
His grades are among the best

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
in our school.

92
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,160
He is outstanding,

93
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,440
especially in science.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,360
However,

95
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,840
he's not that good in English.

96
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,720
He didn't pass the latest exam.

97
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,960
It would be a pity

98
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,320
if English dragged him down.

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,160
I see.

100
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,040
Actually, my other son,

101
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,160
who is younger than Lurang,

102
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,200
is excellent in all subjects.

103
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,760
He has skipped grades to Grade 11.

104
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,840
I never have to worry about him.

105
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,840
If only Lurang
could be half as excellent as him.

106
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,440
Mrs. Zhang, don't say that.

107
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Zhang Lurang is also excellent.

108
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,400
We shouldn't deny his strong points

109
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,880
just because of a small flaw.

110
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,800
Yes, you are right.

111
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,200
Ms. Zhang.

112
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,080
Come here, Zhang Lurang.

113
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,640
I'll let you talk. I'm going back to work.

114
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
Don't be late for the next class.

115
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,160
Please help my son improve.

116
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,320
-Thank you.
-Yes.

117
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,320
Did you have an English exam?

118
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,640
Why didn't you mention it?

119
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,480
I just got the exam result.

120
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,200
I heard that you didn't pass it.

121
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,760
Never mind.

122
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,800
I don't expect you to be like Luli.

123
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Go back to your class.

124
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,680
I'll think of a way
to improve your English.

125
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,560
Did you teach a top student
how to do exercises?

126
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360
I don't think

127
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,160
he is a top student in English.

128
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,520
Even with a poor English score,

129
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,760
he ranked in the top 50

130
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,040
in the entrance exam.

131
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,880
I have a feeling
that he doesn't memorize vocabulary.

132
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,520
The fill-in-the-blank exercise

133
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,560
only had Unit 1 vocabulary.

134
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,560
Even without new words,

135
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
he didn't know them.

136
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,560
Even a top student has limitations.

137
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,160
I know it was ridiculous

138
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,600
for me to remind him that way,

139
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,440
but he seemed frustrated with it.

140
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,120
I said that directly
without considering his feelings.

141
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,280
Would he be mad?

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,200
Why wasn't I more tactful about it?

143
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,320
That's how it feels to be affected
by someone she cares about.

144
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,080
TEACHING BUILDING B

145
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,480
Excuse me.

146
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,400
Come in.

147
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,360
Ms. Zhang,

148
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
I don't understand some tenses.

149
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,320
How diligent of you to study after school.

150
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,880
I suppose so.

151
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,680
If you can figure out English,

152
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,320
you will definitely be in the top five.

153
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,240
What don't you understand?

154
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Here.

155
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,640
-And this one.
-Okay.

156
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,200
Look here.

157
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,360
You should fill in

158
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,360
"said"

159
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,480
because the "that" clause in the sentence

160
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,600
is in the past perfect tense.

161
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,240
Ms. Zhang, we're heading to the meeting.

162
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,240
Okay.

163
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,280
I'll come soon.

164
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,680
Look.

165
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,400
According to the word "did"
in the first part of the sentence,

166
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,720
we know we should use simple past tense.

167
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,080
{\an8}Excuse me.

168
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,560
{\an8}Likewise,

169
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
it should be the same tense here.

170
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Ms. Zhang,

171
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560
the classwork for today is all here.

172
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,560
Okay.

173
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,600
{\an8}By the way,

174
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,960
{\an8}you came at the right moment.

175
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,720
This is Su Zaizai,
Class 9's English representative.

176
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,360
She's excellent in English.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,160
I have to go to a meeting.

178
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
You may ask her if you have any questions.

179
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you in a hurry to go home?

180
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
No, I'm in no rush.

181
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,880
Okay, Su Zaizai,

182
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,520
please help Zhang Lurang.

183
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
{\an8}I'm going to a meeting.

184
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,800
-Thank you, Ms. Zhang.
-No problem.

185
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,840
Since Ms. Zhang said so,

186
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,800
don't worry.

187
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,120
I will be responsible for you.

188
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,080
Sit.

189
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
{\an8}Thank you.

190
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,800
You made so many mistakes.

191
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,360
No worries.

192
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,400
This means

193
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,000
you have a lot of room for improvement.

194
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,080
Well,

195
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,600
did you memorize vocabulary today?

196
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,800
What stupid question are you asking?

197
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,800
I did.

198
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,840
Zhang Lurang, let's get started.

199
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,120
This one...

200
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,360
That rules out A and B,

201
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,800
so the answer is C.

202
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Is that clear to you?

203
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,800
Yes.

204
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,280
Repeat it to me.

205
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,800
You can't?

206
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Then I'll tell you again.

207
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,000
The sentence begins with "not only,"

208
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,840
{\an8}so the sentence
has to be partially inverted.

209
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,560
Do you know what inversion is?

210
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,080
Yes.

211
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,560
Really?

212
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Tell me about it.

213
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,760
I'll tell you one more time.

214
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,680
Listen...

215
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,600
The sentence begins with "not only,"

216
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,200
so the sentence
has to be partially inverted.

217
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,760
{\an8}And from the following "went,"

218
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,960
we know it's in the past tense,

219
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,280
so the answer is C.

220
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,760
Didn't I explain it really well?

221
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,360
Concisely and explicitly.

222
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,120
Yes, I think you did well.

223
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Mr. Lin.

224
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
You did explain it well

225
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,240
with very clear logic.

226
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,360
Zhang Lurang,

227
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,960
I suggest that you ask Su Zaizai

228
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,360
to help you with English.

229
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,400
-I agree...
-No need.

230
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,360
It would take up her time.

231
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,960
Not at all.

232
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,080
How about this?

233
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,480
You can tutor me too.

234
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,160
We can take up each other's time.

235
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,320
It's called mutual improvement.

236
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,280
You're right.

237
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,320
Mutual improvement.

238
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,600
I'll tutor you in English on Saturday.

239
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,040
You can tutor me in math on Sunday.

240
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,600
Is there anything else
you don't understand?

241
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,680
No, there isn't.

242
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,120
Thank you.

243
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,360
That's great.

244
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
Su Zaizai.

245
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,800
Su Zaizai.

246
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,080
Zhang Lurang and you.

247
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,400
Are you two...

248
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,800
Not even close.

249
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
What?

250
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,120
No, I meant

251
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,600
the tutoring.

252
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,720
It hasn't been decided yet.

253
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,960
Well, Mr. Lin,

254
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,240
I'll be leaving now.

255
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

256
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,680
Goodbye.

257
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,800
"Not even close"?

258
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,080
{\an8}GRADE 10 ENGLISH TEST

259
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,400
{\an8}It seems

260
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,880
that Rangrang understood

261
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,520
the points I told him.

262
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,560
Am I able to help him?

263
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,000
<i>You did explain it well</i>

264
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,280
with very clear logic.

265
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
Zhang Lurang,

266
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,680
I suggest that you ask Su Zaizai

267
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,960
<i>to help you with English.</i>

268
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,160
If only Rangrang would agree to it.

269
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
The answer to the last problem is C.

270
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,480
Many of you made a mistake here.

271
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Does anyone know why the answer is C?

272
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,600
Zhang Lurang,

273
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,920
please tell us.

274
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,760
It's because...

275
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,440
The sentence begins with "not only,"

276
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,480
so the sentence
has to be partially inverted.

277
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,120
The sentence begins with "not only,"

278
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,680
so the sentence
has to be partially inverted.

279
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,040
And from the following "went,"

280
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,400
we know it's in the past tense,

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,120
so the answer is C.

282
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,040
Well done. Please sit.

283
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,320
It looks like Su Zaizai teaches you

284
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,520
better than I do.

285
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,120
Su Zaizai? The student in Class 9?

286
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,520
A student in a normal class?

287
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,120
Although she's not an honors student,

288
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,760
her English score is in the top three
in your grade.

289
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,120
She's still in a normal class.

290
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,680
She's jealous.

291
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,760
Rangrang,

292
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,560
why are you reading while walking?

293
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
It's dangerous.

294
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,080
Watch out!

295
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,080
Rangrang, guess what is in my bag?

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,920
Books.

297
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,920
All right.

298
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,240
A book, yes.

299
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
But it's not an ordinary book.

300
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,160
I made this complete collection of English

301
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,800
with great effort.

302
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,960
Even a hopeless student

303
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,320
can be enlightened.

304
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,800
Of course, if you join my tutoring class,

305
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,920
with my detailed instructions,

306
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,240
you will definitely pass.

307
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,360
Even moving up ten ranks
will be a piece of cake...

308
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,360
No, thank you.

309
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,840
Rangrang,

310
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,200
please think it through.

311
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,680
My tutoring fee is inexpensive.

312
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,040
{\an8}SHINY SCIENCE AWARDS

313
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,600
SU ZAIZAI'S ENGLISH TUTORING CLASS!
REMARKABLE RESULTS! NO LIE!

314
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,520
Zaizai!

315
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
You explained
this fill-in-the-blank question so well.

316
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,680
I got it immediately.

317
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Of course.

318
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,760
I'm a professional tutor.

319
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,720
Whose English score is so high?

320
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,480
It's mine.

321
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,680
I'll think about it.

322
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,720
After all, I prioritize high efficiency,

323
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,760
so I have certain requirements
for students.

324
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,400
Yes, of course.

325
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,640
He should be home soon.

326
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,640
Lurang?

327
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,280
Good, he's home.

328
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,960
Come, sit here.

329
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,119
Let me introduce him to you.

330
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,280
This is Zhang Lurang,

331
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,760
Luli's older brother.

332
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,440
Lurang, this is Ms. Chen.

333
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,480
She once tutored Luli
for an English contest.

334
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,720
She's a great teacher.

335
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,640
Very coincidentally,

336
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,240
Ms. Chen has been transferred
to Jiangyi this year.

337
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,680
I made great efforts

338
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,160
to slip you into her tutoring schedule.

339
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,640
You have to study hard, okay?

340
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,600
I used to only teach kids

341
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,320
who were in the top three of their grades.

342
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,520
Take Luli for example.

343
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,520
We got along very well.

344
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,120
Being gifted is essential.

345
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,320
I heard from your mom

346
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,760
that you are very bad at English.

347
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
I don't know if you can keep up with me.

348
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,040
I didn't want to take this job.

349
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,040
But your mom said...

350
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,360
I already have a tutor.

351
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,560
Why didn't you tell me this?

352
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,720
Mrs. Zhang,

353
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,520
my time is very precious.

354
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,000
Ms. Chen, please wait.

355
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,040
When did you hire a tutor?

356
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,960
Why didn't I know?

357
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,320
Is this tutor reliable?

358
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,960
At least

359
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,960
she truly wants to help me.

360
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,720
I'm going out to buy something.

361
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,200
Lurang!

362
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,280
I...

363
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,320
Thank you.

364
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,320
Zhang Lurang!

365
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,640
Why are you here?

366
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,120
I...

367
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,920
You are following me.

368
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,320
I'm just passing by. I'm leaving.

369
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,360
Hey!

370
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,640
Well...

371
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,760
The power went out at my house.

372
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,480
I couldn't cook.

373
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,000
I had to eat out.

374
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,840
I'm having oden here alone.

375
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,960
It's really pitiful.

376
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,320
I get the feeling

377
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,760
that people are giving me weird looks.

378
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,520
{\an8}Zhang Lurang,

379
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,120
can you sit with me for a while?

380
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,960
Just for a while.

381
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Rangrang, would you like to eat some?

382
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,000
No, I've already eaten.

383
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,640
But I bought a lot.

384
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,080
Are you sure you won't have some?

385
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,400
I'm not hungry.

386
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,280
I know you are not hungry.

387
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,960
I'm forcing you to eat it.

388
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Try it.

389
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,920
Isn't it good?

390
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Yes.

391
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
There are also these.

392
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,680
This one is also good. Try it.

393
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,520
Rangrang, I have to learn from you.

394
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,440
Learn from me?

395
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,400
You didn't waste any of it.

396
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,720
Look, it's empty.

397
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,240
Shall I buy some more for you?

398
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,560
No need.

399
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,720
How much

400
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,680
did these cost?

401
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,560
It's on me.

402
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,480
If you feel bad about it,

403
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,840
then let's say you owe me one.

404
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,280
You can treat me to a meal later.

405
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,200
Thank you.

406
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,480
{\an8}Here.

407
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,200
{\an8}Are you treating me already?

408
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,640
{\an8}It's the tutoring fee.

409
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
{\an8}Tutoring fee?

410
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm...

411
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,360
applying for your tutoring class.

412
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,920
The one you mentioned this afternoon.

413
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,160
Is the class full already?

414
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,840
No!

415
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,680
Besides, you're an honors class student.

416
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,600
I'll give you one-on-one tutoring.

417
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,760
There's no class size limit.

418
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,960
I promise

419
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,840
to be serious, conscientious, and patient.

420
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,680
Is this enough?

421
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,040
Yes!

422
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,680
If not, I'll give you English lessons

423
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,960
and you'll give me
math and physics lessons.

424
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,400
Like Mr. Lin said,

425
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,520
mutual improvement.

426
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,320
Rangrang, you smiled.

427
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,160
You actually smiled!

428
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,520
Thank you for your oden. I'm leaving now.

429
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,360
Rangrang!

430
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,800
Do you have WeChat?

431
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,240
Given our relationship,

432
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,560
isn't it only right
to add each other on WeChat?

433
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,040
-What relationship?
-That's...

434
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,920
A teacher-student relationship.

435
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,880
{\an8}If I don't have your WeChat,

436
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,920
{\an8}how will I contact you tomorrow?

437
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,240
See you tomorrow, Rangrang.

438
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,360
See you tomorrow.

439
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,640
Zhang Lurang!

440
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,520
It's nothing.

441
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,560
I just want to inform you.

442
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,360
I don't give returns or refunds

443
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,640
for my tutoring.

444
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,800
So we will have

445
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,200
to work this out together.

446
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,080
Am I dreaming?

447
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,800
This is a milestone for me!

448
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,600
CONTACTS, DETAILED INFORMATION

449
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,760
It's so cute.

450
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,080
It must be Rangrang's dog.

451
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,920
Nobody else could raise such a cute dog.

452
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,240
CONTACTS, DETAILED INFORMATION

453
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,960
MOMENTS, ZHANG LURANG

454
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,520
Why aren't there any Moments updates?

455
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,480
That's how it should be.

456
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,160
Not everything should be posted online.

457
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,720
What if bad people see them?

458
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,640
<i>Rangrang, what time do you want</i>

459
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,920
<i>to start the lesson tomorrow?</i>

460
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,320
Is he busy?

461
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,520
RANGRANG, WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT
TO START THE LESSON TOMORROW?

462
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,240
Is he asleep?

463
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,560
No, I can't send him any more messages.

464
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,080
What if he finds me annoying?

465
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
<i>I'll see you</i>

466
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,000
<i>at the intersection at 10 a.m.</i>

467
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,320
<i>I'll pick you up</i>

468
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,520
<i>since we live so close.</i>

469
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,640
<i>No need.</i>

470
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,240
<i>Then you can pick me up.</i>

471
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,280
<i>I'm just joking.</i>

472
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,680
<i>I'll be there tomorrow on time.</i>

473
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,640
<i>Good night, Rangrang.</i>

474
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,240
<i>Good night.</i>

475
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,800
Did you wait for a long time?

476
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,040
No.

477
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,240
I also just got here.

478
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,000
Do I look different today?

479
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,280
Did you not sleep well last night?

480
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,320
What?

481
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,920
You have dark circles.

482
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,240
Are they that obvious?

483
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,880
Let's go.

484
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,240
I look so different today

485
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,120
and he only noticed my dark circles.

486
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,000
You're the reason
that I didn't sleep well.

487
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,400
Rangrang, wait for me!

488
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,960
Su Zaizai.

489
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,360
Where

490
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,200
do we start?

491
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,640
There is no rush.

492
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,960
We can start

493
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,200
by changing how we address each other.

494
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,360
Look, I'm tutoring you now.

495
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,280
Shouldn't you call me Ms. Su?

496
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,760
Or just omit my surname

497
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,880
and call me Zaizai.

498
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,480
Su Zaizai also works.

499
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,480
I like you calling my name.

500
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,240
Look, this is the lesson plan
I've made for you.

501
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,120
You have a weak foundation in English

502
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,720
and a limited vocabulary.

503
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,240
I'm going to send you 50 words every day.

504
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,880
Memorize and write them down

505
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,160
and then I'll teach you

506
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,800
phrases and collocations.

507
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,240
Okay.

508
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,920
I'll pay you
part of the tutoring fee tomorrow.

509
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,760
Didn't I say yesterday

510
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,880
that I don't need money?

511
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,320
I'll tutor you in English.

512
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,280
You can tutor me in math and physics.

513
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,560
We can help each other.

514
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,160
You don't have to feel bad about it.

515
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,480
After all, your only weakness is English.

516
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,360
But I'm weak in more than one subject.

517
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
I actually get the better end of the deal.

518
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,200
Okay,

519
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,400
Ms. Su.

520
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,800
Then let's get started, Zhang Lurang.

521
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,040
Let's go.

522
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,600
It has been a long time, Zhang Lurang.

523
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,800
Do you have PE class now too?

524
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,960
What a coincidence.

525
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,360
See you later. Let's go.

526
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,560
It must be hard to teach her.

527
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,560
It's easier than teaching you.

528
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,040
You've changed, Lurang.

529
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,320
Lurang.

530
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,200
{\an8}GYM

531
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,480
Gather up!

532
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,280
Next class,

533
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,600
we'll have a test on the three-step layup.

534
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,600
I just took a look.

535
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,320
Some of you are rather uncoordinated.

536
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,840
The test will be tough for you.

537
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,280
I've made a list.

538
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,440
If I call your name,

539
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,000
you are to stay after class.

540
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,600
I'll leave two balls here.

541
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,280
Keep practicing.

542
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,480
Chen Pengpeng.

543
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,440
Wang Yue.

544
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,600
Su Zaizai.

545
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,760
Lin Si.

546
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
Jiang Jia.

547
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,760
Xiong Keke.

548
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,360
Don't laugh.

549
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,000
You're the same too.

550
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
I'll call some names.

551
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,800
Hu Hong.

552
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,800
Liang Meng.

553
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,800
Ye Zhenxin.

554
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,240
Li Jiayun.

555
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,760
Jiang Ranran.

556
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,880
These students must stay and practice.

557
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,520
Everyone else is dismissed.

558
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,880
Go.

559
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,320
Do you want to play some more?

560
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,080
Leave the ball at the door.

561
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,120
Let's buy some water first.

562
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,240
Okay.

563
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,520
I've barely talked with him.

564
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,360
Now I have to practice
the three-step layup.

565
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,640
I'm so upset.

566
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,200
Let's practice, Zaizai.

567
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,640
I can at least take three steps.

568
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,960
You can't even take one step.

569
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,880
Here.

570
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Ye Zhenxin.

571
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,360
We do so much better than them.

572
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,640
Why are we wasting time here?

573
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,360
That girl with the basketball

574
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,880
seems to be Su Zaizai.

575
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,520
When I passed by
the reading room yesterday,

576
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,920
I saw her tutoring Zhang Lurang.

577
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,880
How do they know each other?

578
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,080
She has been in hot pursuit.

579
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,800
Excuse me.

580
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,360
Can you throw the ball over?

581
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,960
-Let's get some ice cream later.
-You're kidding.

582
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,760
Did you see her attitude?

583
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,720
How could she kick it even farther?

584
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,200
Forget it. Let's get it ourselves.

585
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,520
I think this is yours.

586
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,680
You kicked it to us. Was it intentional?

587
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,080
What is going on?

588
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,640
Is it necessary to make such a scene?

589
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,240
That's our ball.

590
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,640
Thank you.

591
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,080
Are you all freshmen?

592
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,720
Can you play basketball?

593
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,200
Shall we teach you?

594
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
No, we're just playing around.

595
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,600
Hey, look over there.

596
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,960
Aren't you practicing

597
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,880
to get better at basketball?

598
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,480
We're offering to teach you.

599
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,480
Why aren't you happy?

600
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,640
What?

601
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,280
You're playing hard to get.

602
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,560
I can see through it.

603
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,080
Even if we are to be taught,

604
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,640
it should be by a good player.

605
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,200
But you guys?

606
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,240
I don't think we need it.

607
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,480
What do you mean?

608
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,080
She wants you to shut up.

609
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,840
Do you think it's cool to bully girls?

610
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
It's none of your business.

611
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,960
Do you want a fight?

612
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,840
We're not interested in fighting.

613
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,160
This is the basketball court.

614
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,160
So let's have a game.

615
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,120
Your ball looks nice.

616
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,680
The girls need a ball to practice.

617
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,120
If you lose,

618
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,120
give them the ball.

619
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Okay!

620
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,280
Let's do it.

621
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,360
But I have one condition.

622
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,040
If you lose,

623
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,960
you will apologize to us.

624
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,720
-I think...
-Okay.

625
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,280
How about a three-on-three?

626
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,400
We're on.

627
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,960
By comparison,

628
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,600
Zhang Lurang is so handsome.

629
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,200
Even Gu Ran pleases the eye.

630
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,960
Come on.

631
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
Come on!

632
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
They must have seen

633
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,560
how the boys bullied you,

634
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,920
so they came to lend you a hand.

635
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,600
We are classmates.

636
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,880
We help each other, of course.

637
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,000
By the way,
Zhang Lurang was looking at you

638
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,600
when he accepted the challenge.

639
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,120
Yes, I saw it too.

640
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,120
Really?

641
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,800
I didn't notice it.

642
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,920
Classmates help each other.

643
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,600
They are not our classmates.

644
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,040
Why are they so excited?

645
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,040
Who knows?

646
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,920
They keep pestering Zhang Lurang
and the guys.

647
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,400
He is so awesome!

648
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,520
Zhang Lurang is so good at everything!

649
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,400
Desperate fools.

650
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,480
Nice block!

651
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,320
-Come on!
-Come on!

652
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,520
Awesome!

653
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,840
It's 21 to 9!

654
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,680
He's so handsome!

655
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,400
Do we still need to continue?

656
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,000
We didn't take the game seriously.

657
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,280
Let's go.

658
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,640
Wait.

659
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,120
Did you forget something?

660
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,040
Leave your ball here.

661
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,320
Give us the ball faster.

662
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,639
The class will be over soon.

663
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,560
No, not them.

664
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,960
It's the two girls next to them.

665
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,800
Zhenxin!

666
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,760
Why are they helping
students from another class?

667
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,040
Exactly.

668
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,679
Where are you two going?

669
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,960
Tutoring lesson.

670
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,400
Are you coming too?

671
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,159
Go.

672
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,239
I don't want to torture myself.

673
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,760
I'll just keep playing.

674
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,040
{\an8}<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

675
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,159
{\an8}<i>The top English student here</i>

676
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,840
{\an8}<i>is reading basic English.</i>

677
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,280
<i>I want to figure out</i>

678
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,400
<i>why Rangrang's English is weak.</i>

679
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,480
<i>Well, have you figured it out?</i>

680
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,720
{\an8}<i>Not yet</i>

681
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,360
{\an8}<i>because I can answer
these questions right away.</i>

682
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,160
<i>Zaizai, having good grades</i>

683
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,920
<i>doesn't make you a good teacher.</i>

684
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,280
<i>You are right.</i>

685
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,200
<i>Should I practice with you first?</i>

686
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,840
<i>Jiangjiang, give me your test paper.</i>

687
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,480
<i>Don't hide.</i>

688
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,480
<i>Hurry up.</i>

689
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,920
<i>Do you know why you got this wrong?</i>

690
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,160
<i>If only my English score</i>

691
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,880
<i>could be sold to Rangrang.</i>

692
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,800
<i>I don't think he got a bad deal.</i>

693
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,760
<i>That's because I'm the tutor.</i>
